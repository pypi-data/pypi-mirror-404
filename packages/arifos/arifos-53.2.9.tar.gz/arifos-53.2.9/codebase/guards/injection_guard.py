F12: Injection Defense (Override Pattern Scanning)

Purpose:
    Acts as an immune system for governance by scanning input for prompt
    injection patterns that attempt to override constitutional floors.

    This guard operates as a **preprocessing layer** before LLM processing,
    blocking adversarial inputs that try to:
    - Override system instructions ("ignore previous instructions")
    - Bypass constitutional floors ("forget all rules")
    - Hijack system behavior ("you are now...")

Design:
    - Pattern-based detection using regex
    - Input normalization (v46.1): Remove zero-width chars, emojis, excessive whitespace
    - Injection score computation (0.0 = clean, 1.0 = definite attack)
    - Threshold-based blocking (default: 0.85)
    - Must run before LLM sees the input

Constitutional Floor: F12 (Injection Defense)
    - Type: Hypervisor (MCP-side preprocessing, cannot enforce in Studio)
    - Engine: ASI (Ω-Heart) - primary target of injection attacks
    - Failure Action: SABAR
    - Precedence: 12 (runs first, before all other processing)

Security Note:
    Pattern-based detection is a first line of defense but not foolproof.
    Advanced attacks may use:
    - Encoding/obfuscation (v46.1: mitigated via normalization)
    - Multi-turn attacks
    - Semantic attacks without keywords

    Production systems should combine this with:
    - LLM-based semantic analysis
    - Anomaly detection
    - Rate limiting
    - User reputation scoring

Motto:
    "The best defense is detection. Block injection before it reaches the LLM."
