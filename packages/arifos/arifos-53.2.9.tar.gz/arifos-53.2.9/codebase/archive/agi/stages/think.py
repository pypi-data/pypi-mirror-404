"""
Stage 222: THINK - Triple Hypothesis Generation

ARIF Loop v52.1 - AGI Room (Mind/Δ)

Scientific Principle: Divergent Exploration / Ensemble Reasoning
Function: Generate THREE independent hypotheses for any query

Unlike sequential thinking (T1→T2→T3), this stage explores THREE PARALLEL
paths simultaneously:

    1. CONSERVATIVE: Safe, proven approach (minimize risk)
    2. EXPLORATORY: Novel approach (maximize learning)
    3. ADVERSARIAL: Stress-test (find holes)

This ensures F13 Curiosity floor is satisfied (≥3 paths explored)
and provides the raw material for 333 REASON to synthesize.

Input:
    - SenseOutput from Stage 111
    - Session context

Output:
    - Three Hypothesis objects (for DeltaBundle.hypotheses)

Constitutional Checks:
    - F7 Humility: Each hypothesis must have confidence ≤ 0.95
    - F13 Curiosity: All 3 paths must be genuinely different
