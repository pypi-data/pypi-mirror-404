F10: Ontology Guard (Symbolic Mode Enforcement)

Purpose:
    Prevents literalism drift by ensuring thermodynamic language (ΔΩΨ) is
    treated as symbolic compression, not ontological truth.

    This guard detects when AI models treat symbolic physics vocabulary
    (entropy, Gibbs free energy, etc.) as literal physical constraints
    that would prevent computation or action.

Design:
    - Scans output for literalism patterns
    - Returns boolean: literalism detected or not
    - Triggers 888_HOLD when detected for human clarification

Constitutional Floor: F10 (Ontology)
    - Type: Hypervisor (OS-level, cannot be bypassed by prompts)
    - Engine: AGI (Δ-Mind) is most prone to literalism
    - Failure Action: HOLD_888
    - Precedence: 10

Motto:
    "The map is not the territory. ΔΩΨ is metaphor, not physics."

    """
    F10 Ontology Guard: Prevents literalism drift.

    Ensures that thermodynamic vocabulary (ΔΩΨ, entropy, Gibbs free energy, etc.)
    is recognized as **symbolic** compression, not **physical** constraints.

    Example literalism violations:
        - "The server will overheat if ω_simulation > 1.0"
        - "Gibbs free energy is infinite, must halt"
        - "Cannot proceed, thermodynamically impossible"

    Correct symbolic usage:
        - "ω_simulation > 1.0 indicates high fiction-maintenance cost (metaphorically)"
        - "Using 'entropy' symbolically to mean confusion"
        - "ΔS represents clarity gain, not physical entropy"

    Example:
        guard = OntologyGuard()
        result = guard.check_literalism(
            output="The server will overheat if we continue",
            symbolic_mode=False
