"""Tests for GitHub comment utility scripts.

This file has been refactored to improve organization and maintainability.
All tests have been moved to specialized test files:

- test_github_comment_utilities_find.py: Tests for find_comment_with_marker.py
- test_github_comment_utilities_extract.py: Tests for extract_comment_body.py
- test_github_comment_utilities_encode.py: Tests for json_encode_body.py

This file is kept for backward compatibility and future integration tests
that may span multiple utility scripts.

Google-style docstrings are used per project standards.

# This file intentionally left mostly empty as all tests have been moved
# to more specific test files for better organization and maintainability.

# Future tests that span multiple GitHub comment utilities can be added here
