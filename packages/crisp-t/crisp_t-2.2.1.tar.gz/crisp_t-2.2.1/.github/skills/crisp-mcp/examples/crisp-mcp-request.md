## Sample Request to Trigger the `crisp-mcp` Skill

Use the `crisp-mcp` skill to run a full mixed‑methods analysis on my project.

I want to explore how patients described their experiences during the COVID era and link those themes to the numeric indicators in the dataset `covid_metrics.csv`.

Please:

- Load the project named `covid_narratives_2020`
- Use the text sources that match `narratives/*.txt`
- Use the numeric dataset `covid_metrics.csv`
- Start with open coding, then develop focused codes and categories
- Generate a triangulation matrix linking themes to hospitalization status and symptom severity
- Produce an analytic memo in Markdown summarizing the findings, convergences, divergences, and any surprising patterns

If you need clarification, ask only one or two focused questions before proceeding.
