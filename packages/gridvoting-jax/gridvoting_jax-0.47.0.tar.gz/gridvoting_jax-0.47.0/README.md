This library provides GPU/TPU/CPU-accelerated spatial voting simulations using Google's JAX framework with float32 precision.

## Origin and Development

This project is derived from the original `gridvoting` module, which was developed for the research publication:

> Brewer, P., Juybari, J. & Moberly, R.  
> A comparison of zero- and minimal-intelligence agendas in majority-rule voting models.  
> J Econ Interact Coord (2023). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11403-023-00387-8

**Migration to JAX**: The computational backend was refactored from NumPy/CuPy to JAX using Google's Antigravity AI assistant. This migration provides:
- ✨ Unified CPU/GPU/TPU support through JAX
- 🚀 Improved performance through JIT compilation  
- 💾 choice of Float32 or Float64 precision
- 🔗 Better compatibility with modern ML/AI workflows

**Original Project**: https://github.com/drpaulbrewer/gridvoting

## Quick Start

Open a new window at https://colab.google

### Installation in Google Colab
To install, add these line at the top of the first cell:
```
!pip install gridvoting-jax
import gridvoting_jax as gv
```

Note: the pip line uses a dash '-' but the import line uses an underscore '_'

####**Float64 Precision**
By default, JAX uses 32-bit floats for faster performance. However, larger models (g>50) should
use 64-bit floats for higher accuracy and to avoid accumulation errors.

To enable 64-bit precision for higher accuracy:
```python
import gridvoting_jax as gv
gv.enable_float64()
#### All subsequent JAX operations will use float64
```

### Spatial Voting Example

```python
import gridvoting_jax as gv

# Use a pre-built example or create your own
# from Brewer, Juybari & Moberly (2023)
# Voter ideal points: [[-15, -9], [0, 17], [15, -9]]
# https://doi.org/10.1007/s11403-023-00387-8
model = gv.bjm_spatial_triangle(g=20, zi=False)
model.analyze()

print(f"Device: {gv.device_type}")  # Shows 'gpu', 'tpu', or 'cpu'
print(f"Core exists: {model.core_exists}")
print(f"Stationary distribution: {model.stationary_distribution[:5]}...")
```

### Budget Voting Example

```python
import gridvoting_jax as gv

# Create budget voting model (divide $100 among 3 voters)
model = gv.BudgetVotingModel(budget=100, zi=False)
model.analyze()

print(f"Alternatives: {model.number_of_alternatives}")  # 5151
print(f"GiniSS inequality: {model.GiniSS[:5]}...")

# Get voter utility distributions
utility_values, probabilities = model.voter_utility_distribution(voter_index=0)

# Get GiniSS inequality distribution
gini_values, gini_probs = model.giniss_distribution(granularity=0.10)
```

## Installation

### Google Colab (Recommended)
To install into Google Colab, add these lines at the top of the first cell:
```
!pip install gridvoting-jax
import gridvoting_jax as gv
```

### Local Installation
If you are using your own computer, not Google Colab, then you need to install the gridvoting-jax python module.

```bash
pip install gridvoting-jax
```

Pip may work; it may not.  If pip issues an error about another system managing the python packages on your computer, then
it may be wise to create a python virtual environment so as not to create conflicts among the python packages.

### Device support

**GPU Support**: JAX automatically detects and uses NVIDIA GPUs (CUDA) when available. An Nvidia A100 works well if you have one, but even an old 2017 gaming Nvidia 1080Ti will run some models.

**TPU Support**: JAX automatically detects TPUs on Google Cloud. TPUs we tried have been quirky with this code.

**CPU Support**: Should run with most CPUs. It will fall back to CPU mode if a GPU or TPU is not detected. RAM >=32GB is useful for some tasks.

**CPU-Only Mode**: If you have a GPU or TPU but want to force CPU-only execution, set environment variable `GV_FORCE_CPU=1`:
```bash
GV_FORCE_CPU=1 python your_script.py
```

### Docker Usage

The project uses a multi-tier Docker image system hosted on GitHub Container Registry (GHCR):
- **Base Images**: JAX + CUDA
- **Release Images**: Versioned releases from PyPI (~30s builds)
- **Dev Images**: Local development with mounted source code

**Quick Start - Local Development:**
```bash
# CPU testing with your local source code
./test_docker.sh --dev --cpu tests/

# GPU testing (auto-detects CUDA 12 or 13)
./test_docker.sh --dev --gpu tests/
```

**Testing Specific Versions:**
```bash
# Test a specific release
./test_docker.sh --version=v0.9.1 --gpu

# Run BJM validation
./test_docker_bjm.sh --dev --gpu --quick
```

**Detailed Documentation:**  
See [`docs/docker.md`](docs/docker.md) for comprehensive Docker usage guide including:
- Image types and GHCR paths
- Development workflow
- CI/CD pipeline
- Troubleshooting

**Building Images Locally:**
```bash
# Build base images (one-time, slow)
docker build -f Dockerfiles/base/Dockerfile.jax-cpu -t base/cpu:local .

# Build dev images (fast)
docker build -f Dockerfiles/dev/Dockerfile.dev-cpu -t dev/cpu:local .
```

## Performance

*Under review*

---

## Differences from Original gridvoting

This JAX version differs from the original in several ways:

| Feature | Original gridvoting | gridvoting-jax |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Backend** | NumPy/CuPy | JAX |
| **Precision** | Float64 | Float32 (default)<br>Float64 (available) |
| **Solver** | Power (Matrix) + Algebraic | Power (vector) + Algebraic |
| **Tolerance** | 1e-10 | variable, up to 1e-10 for float64 |
| **Device Detection** | GPU/CPU | TPU/GPU/CPU |
| **Import** | `import gridvoting` | `import gridvoting_jax` |

**Numerical Accuracy**: Float32 provides ~7 decimal digits of precision, which can be sufficient for some spatial voting simulations.

## Random Sequential Voting Simulations

This follows [section 2 of our research paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11403-023-00387-8#Sec4).

A simulation consists of:
- A sequence of times: `t=0,1,2,3,...`
- A finite feasible set of alternatives **F**
- A set of voters who have preferences over the alternatives and vote truthfully
- A rule for voting and selecting challengers
- In a Spatial Voting Simulatoin, a mapping of the set of alternatives **F** into a 2D grid (x,y coordinates)

The active or status quo alternative at time t is called `f[t]`.

At each t, there is a majority-rule vote between alternative `f[t]` and a challenger alternative `c[t]`. The winner of that vote becomes the next status quo `f[t+1]`.

**Randomness** enters through two possible rules for choosing the challenger `c[t]`:
- **Zero Intelligence (ZI)** (`zi=True`): `c[t]` is chosen uniformly at random from **F**
- **Minimal Intelligence (MI)** (`zi=False`): `c[t]` is chosen uniformly from the status quo `f[t]` and the possible winning alternatives given `f[t]`

---

## API Documentation (v0.30.0)

The package is organized into submodules, but the public API is exposed at the top level for convenience.

```python
import gridvoting_jax as gv
```

### Core Configuration (`gv.core`)

Centralized configuration and constants.

- **`gv.enable_float64()`**: Enable 64-bit floating point precision globally for JAX
- **`gv.device_type`**: Current device type ('gpu', 'tpu', or 'cpu')
- **`gv.use_accelerator`**: Boolean indicating if GPU/TPU is available

### Geometric Components (`gv.geometry`)

#### `class Grid`

```python
grid = gv.Grid(x0, x1, xstep=1, y0, y1, ystep=1)
```

Constructs a 2D grid for spatial voting models.

**Properties:**
- `grid.points`: JAX array of shape `(N, 2)` containing `[x, y]` coordinates
- `grid.x`, `grid.y`: 1D JAX arrays of x and y coordinates
- `grid.boundary`: 1D boolean mask for boundary points
- `grid.len`: Total number of grid points

**Methods:**
- **`spatial_utilities(voter_ideal_points, metric='sqeuclidean')`**: Distance-based utility calculation
- **`within_box/disk/triangle(...)`**: Geometric query methods returning boolean masks
- **`extremes(z, valid=None)`**: Find min/max values and their locations
- **`embedding(valid)`**: Create embedding function for plotting subsets
- **`plot(z, ...)`**: Plot scalar fields on the grid using Matplotlib

#### `class PolarGrid`

```python
grid = gv.PolarGrid(radius, rstep=1, thetastep=15)
```

Constructs a 2D polar grid for spatial voting models with radial symmetry.

**Parameters:**
- `radius`: Maximum radius of the grid
- `rstep`: Radial step size (default: 1)
- `thetastep`: Angular step size in degrees (default: 15)

**Properties:**
- `grid.points`: JAX array of shape `(N, 2)` containing `[x, y]` coordinates in Cartesian space
- `grid.r`, `grid.theta`: 1D JAX arrays of radial and angular coordinates
- `grid.weights`: 1D JAX array of area-based weights for each grid cell
- `grid.len`: Total number of grid points (1 + (n_rings * n_angular_positions))

**Methods:**
- **`index(r=None, theta=None, x=None, y=None)`**: Find grid index from polar or Cartesian coordinates
- **`partition_from_rotation(angle)`**: Create partition for rotational symmetry
  - `angle=0`: Continuous rotation symmetry (SO(2)) - each ring forms a partition
  - `angle>0`: Discrete rotation symmetry (cyclic group C_n) - each ring is tiled n-fold into k partitions where n=360/angle, k=angle/thetastep
  - Angle must divide 360 and be a multiple of `thetastep`
- **`plot(z, ...)`**: Plot scalar fields using polar contour plot

**Notes:**
- Grid points are arranged in concentric rings around the origin
- The origin (r=0) is a single point
- Weights represent the area of each grid cell in state space
- Useful for models with radial or rotational symmetry

### Symmetry & Dimension Reduction
Reduce computational cost by exploiting spatial symmetries.

Known issue: Practicality.  Time currently required to calculate symmetries and lumping is often higher than solution time
of the original model.

```python
import gridvoting_jax as gv
import jax.numpy as jnp
from gridvoting_jax.symmetry import suggest_symmetries

# 1. Detect Symmetries
# Suggest valid spatial symmetries for the model
symmetries = suggest_symmetries(model)
print(f"Detected: {symmetries}") 

# 2. Partition Grid
# Create partition using inverse indices (JAX array format)
# partition[i] gives the group ID for state i
partition = model.grid.partition_from_symmetry(['reflect_x'])
print(f"Partition shape: {partition.shape}")  # (N,) array
print(f"Number of groups: {int(partition.max()) + 1}")

# 3. Lump Markov Chain
# Solve on reduced state space (e.g., 50% fewer states)
lumped_mc = gv.lump(model.MarkovChain, partition)
lumped_pi = lumped_mc.solve()

# 4. Unlump
# Map results back to full grid
stationary_distribution = gv.unlump(lumped_pi, partition)

# Verify Lumpability (optional)
# Check if partition preserves Markov property
is_valid = gv.is_lumpable(model.MarkovChain, partition)
print(f"Strongly lumpable: {is_valid}")
```

**Partition Format** :
- Partitions are represented as **inverse indices** (JAX arrays)
- Format: `jnp.ndarray` of shape `(N,)` where `partition[i]` is the group ID for state `i`
- Example: `jnp.array([0, 0, 1, 1])` means states 0,1 are in group 0; states 2,3 are in group 1
- Migration helper: `gv.list_partition_to_inverse(old_partition, n_states)` converts from list-based partition format to inverse indices

**Symmetry Types**:
- `'reflect_x'`: Reflection across x=0 (vertical line)
- `'reflect_y'`: Reflection across y=0 (horizontal line)
- `'reflect_x=c'`: Reflection across x=c (custom vertical line)
- `'reflect_y=c'`: Reflection across y=c (custom horizontal line)
- `'swap_xy'`: Diagonal reflection (x,y) ↔ (y,x)
- `('rotate', cx, cy, angle)`: Rotation by `angle` degrees around `(cx, cy)`

**Performance**:
- Singleton symmetries (single symmetry) use optimized fast path
- Multiple symmetries use general connected components algorithm
- Lumping uses fully vectorized JAX operations)
```

### Pareto Efficiency
Finds the Pareto Optimal set (points where no other point is unanimously preferred).

```python
# Get a boolean mask for Pareto set
pareto_mask = model.Pareto

# Visualize
model.grid.plot(pareto_mask, title="Pareto Set")

# Create Unanimous Model
unanimous_model = model.unanimize()
```

### Example Models

#### Plott's Theorem Examples

Demonstrate core existence conditions from Plott's median-in-all-directions voter theorem:

> Plott, C. R. (1967). A notion of equilibrium and its possibility under majority rule. *American Economic Review*, 57(4), 787-806.

```python
# Core existence examples
model = gv.core1(g=20, zi=False)  # 5 voters on horizontal line
model = gv.core2(g=20, zi=False)  # 5 voters on vertical line  
model = gv.core3(g=20, zi=False)  # 5 voters on diagonal
model = gv.core4(g=20, zi=False)  # 4 corners + center
model = gv.ring_with_central_core(g=20, r=10, voters=7)  # Ring + center

# No-core example
model = gv.nocore_triangle(g=20, zi=False)  # (cycling)
```

#### Shapes Submodule

Random and geometric configurations:

```python
# Random triangle
model = gv.shapes.random_triangle(g=20, within=10, zi=False)

# Ring of voters (must be odd)
model = gv.shapes.ring(g=20, r=10, voters=5, round_ideal_points=True)
```

#### BJM Research Examples

Examples from:

> Brewer, P., Juybari, J. & Moberly, R. (2023). A comparison of zero- and minimal-intelligence agendas in majority-rule voting models. *Journal of Economic Interaction and Coordination*. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11403-023-00387-8

```python
# Spatial voting (Triangle 1 from BJM research)
model = gv.bjm_spatial_triangle(g=20, zi=False)

# Budget voting
model = gv.bjm_budget_triangle(budget=100, zi=False)
```

### Markov Chain (`gv.stochastic`)

#### `class MarkovChain`

```python
mc = gv.MarkovChain(P)
mc.solve(solver="full_matrix_inversion")

# With partitions for automatic lumping/unlumping
partition = model.grid.partition_from_symmetry(['reflect_x'])
mc.solve(solver="full_matrix_inversion", partitions=partition)
```

**Parameters:**
- `solver`: Strategy to use (see solver options below)
- `initial_guess`: Optional starting distribution for iterative solvers
- `partitions`: Optional JAX array for automatic Markov chain lumping/unlumping. When provided, the chain is lumped using the partition, solved on the reduced state space, then unlumped back to the original space. See [Symmetry & Dimension Reduction](#symmetry--dimension-reduction) section for details.
- `time_per_digit`: Time budget (seconds) per digit of precision for iterative solvers (default: 1.0)

> [!NOTE]
> **API Change**: The `MarkovChain` method `find_unique_stationary_distribution` has been renamed to `solve` for a more concise API aligned with scientific computing conventions.

**Solver Selection Guide**:

| Grid Size | Recommended Solver | Alternative | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|-------|
| g=20-40 | `full_matrix_inversion` | `outline_and_gmres` | Fastest, most accurate |
| g=60 | `gmres_matrix_inversion` | `outline_and_gmres` | Balance speed/memory |

# Reuse for multiple models with same grid size
model1.analyze(solver="outline_and_fill", interpolation_matrix=C)
model2.analyze(solver="outline_and_fill", interpolation_matrix=C)
```
### Large Grid Support 

- **g=80**: Validated (L1 ~1e-08)
- **g=100**: 10,201 alternatives, uses lazy solvers + outline solvers

```python
model = gv.bjm_spatial_triangle(g=100, zi=False)
model.analyze(solver="outline_and_power")  # Recommended for large grids
```
### Datasets (`gv.datasets`)

- **`gv.datasets.fetch_bjm_spatial_voting_2022_a100()`**: Downloads BJM reference dataset

---

## Benchmarks

Run performance benchmarks to test solver speed across different grid sizes:

```python
import gridvoting_jax as gv

# Print formatted benchmark results
gv.benchmarks.run_comparison_report()

# download the reference dataset
gv.datasets.fetch_bjm_spatial_voting_2022_a100()

# compare your computed results to the published scientific record using L1 norm
gv.benchmarks.run_comparison_report()

# Get results as dictionary for programmatic use
results = gv.benchmarks.performance(dict=True)
print(f"Device: {results['device']}")
print(f"JAX version: {results['jax_version']}")
for test in results['results']:
    print(f"{test['test_case']}: {test['time_seconds']:.4f}s")
```

**Benchmark Test Cases**:
- Grid sizes: g=20, g=40, g=60
- Voting modes: ZI (Zero Intelligence) and MI (Minimal Intelligence)
- 6 test cases total

---

## Replication & Verification against BJM Data

You can automatically verify the library's output against the original A100 GPU replication data from the BJM research. This benchmark downloads the reference data and compares stationary distributions using the L1 norm.

```python
from gridvoting_jax.benchmarks.bjm_comparison import run_comparison_report

# Run complete comparison report
# Automatically downloads reference data to /tmp/gridvoting_bjm_cache
report = run_comparison_report()

# Or test specific configurations
# report = run_comparison_report([(20, False)])  # g=20, MI mode
```

### Google Colab Usage

In a Colab notebook, you can run the full verification suite in a single cell:

```python
!pip install gridvoting-jax

from gridvoting_jax.benchmarks.bjm_comparison import run_comparison_report

# Run all 8 replication configurations (g=20, 40, 60, 80)
report = run_comparison_report()
```

This compares your computer's simulation results to the published scientific record.
