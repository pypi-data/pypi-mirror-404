Modern API wrapper for HoYoLAB & Miyoushe(米游社) API built on asyncio and pydantic.

## Project Transferred

genshin.py was originally started by [ashleney](https://github.com/ashleney), due to lack of time to maintain, it has been transferred to [seriaati](https://github.com/seriaati).

Downloading the package from <https://github.com/ashleney/genshin.py> will still work because GitHub automatically redirects to the new repository.

## Useful Links

- [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/sMkSKRPuCR)

## Introduction

The primary focus of genshin.py is convenience. The entire project is fully type-hinted and abstracts a large amount of the api to be easier to use.

Key features:

- All data is in the form of Pydantic Models which means full autocompletion and linter support.
- Requests are significantly faster thanks to proper usage of asyncio.
- Chinese and English names returned by the API are renamed to simpler English fields.
- Supports the majority of the popular endpoints.
- Cleanly integrates with frameworks like FastAPI out of the box.

> Note: This library is a successor to [genshinstats](https://github.com/seriaati/genshinstats) - an unofficial wrapper for the Genshin Impact api.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- aiohttp 3.0+
- Pydantic 2.0+
- tenacity 9.0+

## Installation

To install the stable version:

```console
pip install genshin
```

You can also install the latest development version from GitHub:

```console
pip install git+https://github.com/seriaati/genshin.py
```

A new release is made every month.

## Example

A very simple example of how genshin.py would be used:

```py
import asyncio
import genshin

async def main():
    cookies = {"ltuid": 119480035, "ltoken": "cnF7TiZqHAAvYqgCBoSPx5EjwezOh1ZHoqSHf7dT"}
    client = genshin.Client(cookies, uid=710785423)

    user = await client.get_genshin_user()
    print(f"User has a total of {user.stats.characters} characters")

asyncio.run(main())
```
