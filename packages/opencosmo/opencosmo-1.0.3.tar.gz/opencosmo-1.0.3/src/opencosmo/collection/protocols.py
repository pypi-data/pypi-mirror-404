    Collections represent a group of datasets that are related in some way. They
    support higher-level operations that are applied across all datasets in the
    collection, sometimes in a non-obvious way.

    This protocol defines methods a collection must implement. Most notably they
    must include  __getitem__, keys, values and __items__, which allows
    a collection to behave like a read-only dictionary.


    Note that the "open" and "read" methods are used in the case an entire collection
    is located within a single file. Multi-file collections are handled
    in the collection.io module. Most complexity is hidden from the user
    who simply calls "oc.read" and "oc.open" to get a collection. The io
    module also does sanity checking to ensure files are structurally valid,
    so we do not have to do it here.
