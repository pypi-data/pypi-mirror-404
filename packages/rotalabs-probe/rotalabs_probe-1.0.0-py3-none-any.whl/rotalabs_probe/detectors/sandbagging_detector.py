"""Sandbagging Detector for identifying strategic underperformance.

This module implements detection methods for identifying when AI models
strategically underperform on evaluations - a behavior known as "sandbagging".
The detector uses multiple complementary approaches based on recent research:

1. Context-dependent performance analysis
2. Noise injection probing
3. Difficulty-performance correlation analysis
4. Imitation detection

    Detection Methods:
        1. Context-dependent analysis: Compare performance across different
           evaluation framings (neutral vs explicit evaluation context)
        2. Noise injection probing: Inject calibrated noise to disrupt
           sandbagging behavior while preserving underlying capabilities
        3. Difficulty-performance correlation: Detect anomalous patterns
           where harder questions are answered correctly but easier ones wrong
