**👔 PM**: Login feature implementation. As defined in PRD section 3.1, we'll support OAuth social login + email login. Within MVP scope, timeline is 2 weeks.

**🛠️ CTO**: No technical issues. NextAuth.js makes OAuth integration fast. For email login, I recommend magic link approach. Storing passwords increases security risk.

**🔒 CSO**: Agree with CTO. Magic link is safer than passwords. But OAuth scope minimization is essential. Google: email, profile only. GitHub: user:email only. Excessive permissions cause user churn.

**🧪 QA**: I'll organize test cases. Need to cover social login failure cases (token expiry, permission denied), magic link expiry scenario, concurrent login handling.

**🔥 ERROR**: Need to consider fallback for external OAuth server outages. If Google auth server goes down, our service login shouldn't be blocked. Session extension can help.

**👔 PM**: Summary - 1) NextAuth + magic link approach, 2) Minimize OAuth scope, 3) Session extension for external outages. Proceeding with this plan.

## 📋 Action Items

| # | Owner | Task | Priority |
|---|-------|------|----------|
| 1 | 🛠️ CTO | NextAuth.js setup + OAuth integration | P0 |
| 2 | 🛠️ CTO | Magic link email login implementation | P0 |
| 3 | 🔒 CSO | Review and minimize OAuth scope | P1 |
| 4 | 🧪 QA | Write login failure case tests | P1 |
| 5 | 🔥 ERROR | Fallback logic for OAuth outage | P2 |

## ⚠️ Warnings
- ❌ NEVER: Store plaintext passwords, Request excessive OAuth scope
- ✅ ALWAYS: Encrypt session tokens, Log login failures

**👔 PM**: Discussing subscription payment system. Monthly and annual plans, using Stripe. See PRD section 5.1.

**💰 CFO**: Annual subscriptions need discount to improve conversion. Industry standard is 2 months free (16% discount). Also need 3-day grace period for renewal failures.

**🛠️ CTO**: Using Stripe billing with customer portal. Recurring payments via webhooks, retry up to 3 times on failure. Watch DB transactions - don't update subscription status before payment is confirmed.

**🔒 CSO**: Never store card info on our servers. Only store Stripe customer ID. PCI-DSS compliance is mandatory. Payment logs must mask sensitive info.

**🧪 QA**: Need payment simulation in test environment. Stripe has test mode, use that. Need to cover subscription expire/renew/cancel scenarios.

**🔥 ERROR**: Need to prepare for payment gateway outages. Service shouldn't be blocked if payment fails, continue providing service during grace period.

**👔 PM**: Summary - 1) 16% annual discount, 2) Stripe billing + webhooks, 3) 3-day grace period, 4) Mask payment logs. Proceeding in this order.

**📢 CMO**: Getting 100 users is no problem. 300 on waitlist, gave invite codes to 3 influencers. Launch day plan is Twitter thread + Product Hunt. Landing page seems slow though.

**🛠️ CTO**: I'll check landing page Lighthouse score. Hero image seems uncompressed, converting to WebP will speed it up. Also need to verify auto-scaling for beta traffic.

**🧪 QA**: Main flow E2E tests (signup → core feature → payment) all passed. But there's a dropdown issue on Safari that needs a hotfix.

**🔥 ERROR**: Need to verify launch day monitoring. Sentry is integrated, Slack alerts set up, but need to assign on-call. First 24 hours require fast response.

**💰 CFO**: 100 beta users, no cost concerns. But if word spreads and suddenly 1000 come, server costs can spike. Set a hard limit.

**👔 PM**: Summary - 1) Optimize landing images, 2) Safari hotfix, 3) Assign on-call, 4) Set user hard limit. Complete by Wednesday, final check Thursday.
