description: Generate comprehensive documentation for code, APIs, and components
---

1. Ask the user what type of documentation to generate:
   - README.md
   - API documentation
   - Component documentation
   - Code comments
   - Architecture documentation

2. Read the relevant code files to understand functionality.

3. For README.md, generate:
   - Project description
   - Quick start guide
   - Features list
   - Installation steps
   - Usage examples
   - Configuration options
   - API reference (if applicable)
   - Contributing guidelines
   - License

4. For API documentation, generate per endpoint:
   - Description
   - HTTP method and path
   - Required headers
   - Request body schema with examples
   - Response schemas (success and error)
   - Example requests using curl

5. For React components, generate:
   - Component description
   - Props table with types and defaults
   - Usage examples
   - Visual examples or Storybook links

6. For architecture documentation, generate:
   - System overview
   - Component diagram
   - Data flow description
   - Key decisions and rationale

7. Create the documentation files in appropriate locations.

8. Include working code examples that can be copied.

9. Keep documentation concise and scannable with clear headings.

10. Review documentation for accuracy against actual code.

## Rules
- Lead with WHAT and WHY
- Include WORKING examples
- Keep paragraphs SHORT
- Use CLEAR headings
- NO walls of text
