# 🔍 POWL Miner
**Process Mining with the Partially Ordered Workflow Language**

The POWL Miner allows you to perform **process discovery from event logs**, leveraging the **Partially Ordered Workflow Language (POWL) 2.0**. The generated POWL 2.0 models can be viewed and exported as BPMNs or Petri nets (PNML). For more details on POWL 2.0, please refer to the paper: [**Unlocking Non-Block-Structured Decisions: Inductive Mining with Choice Graphs**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07052).
