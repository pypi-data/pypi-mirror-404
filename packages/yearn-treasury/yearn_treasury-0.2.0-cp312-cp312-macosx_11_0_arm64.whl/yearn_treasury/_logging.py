"""
Error log suppression utilities for the Yearn Treasury exporter.

This module suppresses noisy or irrelevant eth-portfolio error logs for specific
token addresses that are known to be deprecated or otherwise unpricable.

To suppress logs for additional tokens, add their addresses to the
`suppress_logs_for[Network.<chain>]` mapping. The rest will be done
automatically on package import.
