"""
Vault discovery and tracking utilities for Yearn Treasury.

This module discovers Yearn vault contracts and maps them to their
underlying assets using Yearn's on-chain registry contracts. It
provides dictionaries for v1 and v2 vaults, supporting transaction
classification, analytics, and reporting across the Yearn Treasury
system.

Key Responsibilities:
    - Discover and map all v1 and v2 vault contracts to underlying assets at startup.
    - Provide lookup tables for use in vault deposit/withdrawal sort rules.
