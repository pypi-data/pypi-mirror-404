# Overview

This package implements two console scripts `read-sqmle` and `read-tessw4c`

Those scripts implement very similar arguments. use `--help` to get a list of usable arguments

The recommended way to make it work is through a configuration file, in order to create a configuration
file use `--config-file-example` and to use an existing configuration file use `--config-file <path-to-file.yaml>`

Examples are not included here because this is a very early state of development.
