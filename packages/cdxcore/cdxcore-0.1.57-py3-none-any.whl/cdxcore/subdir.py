"""
Utilities for file i/o, directory management and
streamlined versioned caching.

Overview
--------

The key idea is to provide transparent, concise :mod:`pickle` access to the file system
via the :class:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir` class.

**Key design features:**

* Simple path construction via ``()`` operator. By default directories which do not exist yet
  are only created upon writing a first file.
     
* Files managed by :class:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir` all have the same extension.

* Files support "fast versioning": the version of a file can be read without having to read the
  entire file.
  
* :dec:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.cache` implements a convenient versioned caching framework.

Directories
^^^^^^^^^^^

The core of the framework is the :class:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir` class which represents a directory
with files of a given extension.

Simply write::

    from cdxcore.subdir import SubDir
    subdir = SubDir("my_directory")      # relative to current working directory
    subdir = SubDir("./my_directory")    # relative to current working directory
    subdir = SubDir("~/my_directory")    # relative to home directory
    subdir = SubDir("!/my_directory")    # relative to default temp directory
    subdir = SubDir("?!/my_directory")   # relative to a temporary temp directory; this directory will be cleared upon (orderly) exit of ``SubDir``.
    
Note that ``my_directoy`` will not be created if it does not exist yet. It will be created the first
time we write a file.

You can specify a parent for relative path names::

    from cdxcore.subdir import SubDir
    subdir = SubDir("my_directory", "~")      # relative to home directory
    subdir = SubDir("my_directory", "!")      # relative to default temp directory
    subdir = SubDir("my_directory", ".")      # relative to current directory
    subdir2 = SubDir("my_directory", subdir)  # subdir2 is relative to `subdir`

Change the extension to "bin"::

    from cdxcore.subdir import SubDir
    subdir = SubDir("~/my_directory;*.bin")     
    subdir = SubDir("~/my_directory", ext="bin")    
    subdir = SubDir("my_directory", "~", ext="bin")    

You can turn off extension management by setting the extension to ``""``::

    from cdxcore.subdir import SubDir
    subdir = SubDir("~/my_directory", ext="")

You can also use :meth:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.__call__` to generate sub directories::

    from cdxcore.subdir import SubDir
    parent = SubDir("~/parent")
    subdir = parent("subdir")

Be aware that when the operator :meth:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.__call__`
is called with two keyword arguments, then it reads files.

You can obtain a list of all sub directories in a directory by using :meth:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.sub_dirs`.
The list of files with the corresponding extension is accessible via :meth:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.files`. 

File Format
^^^^^^^^^^^

:class:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir` supports file i/o with a number of different file formats:
    
* ``PICKLE``: standard pickling with default extension "pck".

* ``JSON_PICKLE``: uses the :mod:`jsonpickle` package; default extension "jpck".
  The advantage of this format over "PICKLE" is that it is somewhat human-readable.
  However, ``jsonpickle`` uses compressed formats for complex objects such as :mod:`numpy`
  arrays, hence readablility is somewhat limited. Using "JSON_PICKLE"
  comes at cost of slower i/o speed.

* ``JSON_PLAIN``: calls :func:`cdxcore.util.plain` is an output-only format to generate human readable files
  which (usually) cannot be loaded back from disk.
  In this mode ``SubDir`` converts objects into plain Python objects before using :mod:`json`
  to write them to disk.
  That means that deserialized data does not have the correct object structure
  for being restored properly.
  However, such files are much easier to read.

* ``BLOSC`` uses `blosc <https://github.com/blosc/python-blosc>`__
  to read/write compressed binary data. The blosc compression algorithm is very fast,
  hence using this mode will not usually lead to notably slower performance than using
  "PICKLE" but will generate smaller files, depending on your data structure.  
  The default extension for "BLOSC" is "zbsc".

* ``GZIP``: uses :mod:`gzip` to 
  to read/write compressed binary data. The default extension is "pgz".
  
* ``POLARS_PARQUET`` writes :class:`polars.DataFrames` using parquet files.
  In this mode, only parquet files can be read and written. Versioning is supported.

**Summary of properties i/o modes:**

You may specify the file format when instantiating :class:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir`::

    from cdxcore.subdir import SubDir
    subdir = SubDir("~/my_directory", fmt=SubDir.PICKLE)
    subdir = SubDir("~/my_directory", fmt=SubDir.JSON_PICKLE)
    ...

If ``ext`` is not specified the extension will defaulted to 
the respective default extension of the format requested.

Reading Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To read the data contained in a ``file`` from our subdirectory
with its reference extension use :meth:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.read`::

    from cdxcore.subdir import SubDir
    subdir = SubDir("!/test")
    
    data = subdir.read("file")                 # returns the default `None` if file.pck is not found
    data = subdir.read("file", default=[])     # returns the default [] if file.pck is not found

This function will return the "default" (which in turns defaults to ``None``)
if "file.pck" does not exist.
You can opt to raise an error instead of returning a default
by using ``raise_on_error=True``::

    data = subdir.read("file", raise_on_error=True)  # raises 'KeyError' if not found

When calling ``read()`` you may specify an alternative extension::

    data = subdir.read("file", ext="bin")     # change extension to "bin"
    data = subdir.read("file.bin", ext="")    # no automatic extension

Specifying a different format for :meth:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.read` only changes
the extension automatically if you have not overwritten it before:

.. code-block:: python

    subdir = SubDir("!/test")                              # default format PICKLE with extension pck
    data   = subdir.read("file", fmt=Subdir.JSON_PICKLE )  # uses "json" extension
    
    subdir = SubDir("!/test", ext="bin")                   # user-specified extension
    data   = subdir.read("file", fmt=Subdir.JSON_PICKLE )  # keeps using "bin"
    
You can also use the :meth:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.__call__` to read files, in which case you must specify a default value
(if you don't, then the operator will return a sub directory)::

    data = subdir("file", None)   # returns None if file is not found

You can also use item notation to access files.
In this case, though, an error will be thrown if the file does not exist::

    data = subdir['file']   # raises KeyError if file is not found

You can read a range of files in one function call::

    data = subdir.read( ["file1", "file2"] )   # returns list

Finally, you can also iterate through all existing files using iterators::

    # manual loading
    for file in subdir:
        data = subdir.read(file)
        ...
        
    # automatic loading, with "None" as a default
    for file, data in subdir.items():
        ...

To obtain a list of all files in our directory which have the correct extension, use :meth:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.files`.

Writing Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Writing files mirrors reading them::

    from cdxcore.subdir import SubDir
    subdir = SubDir("!/test")
    
    subdir.write("file", data)
    subdir['file'] = data

You may specifify different a extension::

    subdir.write("file", data, ext="bin")

You can also specify a file :class:`cdxcore.subdir.Format`.
The extension will be changed automatically if you have not set it manually::

    subdir = SubDir("!/test")
    subdir.write("file", data, fmt=SubDir.JSON_PICKLE )   # will write to "file.json"

To write several files at once, write::

    subdir.write(["file1", "file"], [data1, data2])

Note that when writing to a file, :meth:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.write`
will first write to a temporary file, and then rename this file into the target file name.
The temporary file name is generated by applying :func:`cdxcore.uniquehash.unique_hash48`
to the
target file name, 
current time, process and thread ID, as well as the machines's UUID. 
This is done to reduce collisions between processes/machines accessing the same files,
potentially accross a network.
It does not remove collision risk entirely, though.

Filenames
^^^^^^^^^

:class:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir` transparently handles directory access and extensions.
That means a user usually only uses ``file`` names which do not contain either.
To  obtain the full qualified filename given a "file" use :meth:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.full_file_name`.

Reading and Writing Versioned Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:class:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir` supports versioned files.
If versions are used, then they *must* be used for both reading and writing.
:dec:`cdxcore.version.version` provides a standard decorator framework for definining
versions for classes and functions including version dependencies.

If a ``version`` is provided for :func:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.write`
then ``SubDir`` will write the version in a block ahead of the main content of the file.
In case of the PICKLE format, this is a byte string. In case of JSON_PLAIN and JSON_PICKLE this is line of
text starting with ``#`` ahead of the file. (Note that this violates
the JSON file format.)
  
Writing a short version block ahead of the main data allows :func:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.read`
to read this version information back quickly without reading the entire file.
``read()`` does attempt so if its called with a ``version`` parameter.
In this case it will compare the read version with the provided version,
and only return the main content of the file if versions match.

Use :func:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.is_version` to check whether a given file has a specific version.
Like ``read()`` this function only reads the information required to obtain the information and will
be much faster than reading the whole file.

*Important:* if a file was written with a ``version``, then it has to be read again with a test version.
You can specify ``version="*"`` for :func:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.read` to match any version.

**Examples:**

Writing a versioned file::

    from cdxcore.subdir import SubDir
    sub_dir = SubDir("!/test_version)
    sub_dir.write("test", [1,2,3], version="0.0.1" )

To read ``[1,2,3]`` from "test" we need to use the correct version::

    _ = sub_dir.read("test", version="0.0.1") 

The following will not read "test" as the versions do not match::

    _ = sub_dir.read("test", version="0.0.2")

By default :func:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.read` 
will not fail if a version mismatch is encountered; rather it will
attempt to delete the file and then return the ``default`` value.

This can be turned off
with the keyword ``delete_wrong_version`` set to ``False``.

You can ignore the version used to writing a file by using ``"*"`` as version::

    _ = sub_dir.read("test", version="*")

Note that reading files which have been written with a ``version`` without
``version`` keyword will fail because ``SubDir`` will only append additional version information
to the file if required.

Test existence of Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To test existence of 'file' in a directory, use one of::

    subdir.exist('file')
    'file' in subdir

Deleting files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To delete a file, use either of the following::

    subdir.delete("file")
    del subdir['file']

All of these are *silent*, and will by default not throw errors if ``file`` does not exist.


In order to throw an error use::

    subdir.delete('file', raise_on_error=True)

A few member functions assist in deleting a number of files:

* :func:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.delete_all_files`: delete all files in the directory with matching extension. Do not delete sub directories, or files with extensions different to our own.
* :func:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.delete_all_content`: delete all files with our extension, including in all sub-directories. If a sub-directory is left empty
  upon ``delete_all_content`` delete it, too.
* :func:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.delete_everything`: deletes *everything*, not just files with matching extensions.

Caching
^^^^^^^

A :class:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir` object offers an advanced context for caching calls to :class:`collection.abc.Callable`
objects with :dec:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.cache`.

.. code-block:: python

    from cdxcore.subdir import SubDir
    cache   = SubDir("!/.cache")
    cache.delete_all_content()   # for illustration
    
    @cache.cache("0.1")
    def f(x,y):
        return x*y
    
    _ = f(1,2)    # function gets computed and the result cached
    _ = f(1,2)    # restore result from cache
    _ = f(2,2)    # different parameters: compute and store result

This involves keying the cache by the function name and its current parameters using :class:`cdxcore.uniquehash.UniqueHash`,
and monitoring the functions version using :dec:`cdxcore.version.version`. The caching behaviour itself can be controlled by
specifying the desired :class:`cdxcore.subdir.CacheMode`.

**See** :dec:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.cache` **for full feature set.**

    **Standard Caching Semantics**

    Assuming we wish to cache results from calling a function ``f`` in a file named ``filename``
    in a directory ``directory``, then this is the ``CacheMode`` waterfall:

    .. code-block:: python

        def cache_f( filename : str, directory : SubDir, version : str, cache_mode : CacheMode ):
            if cache_mode.delete:

                                   version=version,
                                   raise_on_error=False,
                                   delete_wrong_version=cache_mode.del_incomp

            r = f(...) # compute result
            
            if cache_mode.write:
                directory.write(filename,
                                r,
                                version=version,

    Parameters
    ----------
    exclude_arg_types : list[type | str], optional
        List of types or names of types to exclude from producing unique ids from function arguments.
        Strings are compated to ``type(arg).__name__``.

        Defaults to ``[Context]``.
        
    cache_mode : CacheMode, default ``ON``
        Top level cache control.
        Set to "OFF" to turn off all caching.
        
    max_filename_length : int, default ``48``
        Maximum filename length. If unique id's exceed the file name a hash of length
        ``hash_length`` will be intergated into the file name.
        See :class:`cdxcore.uniquehash.NamedUniqueHash`.
        
    hash_length : int, default ``8``
        Length of the hash used to make sure each filename is unique
        See :class:`cdxcore.uniquehash.NamedUniqueHash`.
        
    debug_verbose : :class:`cdxcore.verbose.Context` | None, default ``None``
        If not ``None`` print caching process messages to this object.
        
    keep_last_arguments : bool, default ``False``
        Keep a dictionary of all parameters as string representations after each function call.
        If the function ``F`` was decorated using :meth:``cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.cache``,
        you can access this information via ``F.cache_info.last_arguments``.

# ========================================================================
# SubDir
# ========================================================================

class SubDir(object):
    r"""
    ``SubDir`` implements a transparent i/o
    interface for storing data in files.
    
    **Directories**

    Instantiate a ``SubDir`` with a directory name. There are some
    pre-defined relative system paths the name can refer to::
    
        from cdxcore.subdir import SubDir
        parent  = SubDir("!/subdir")         # relative to system temp directory
        parent  = SubDir("~/subdir")         # relative to user home directory
        parent  = SubDir("./subdir")         # relative to current working directory (explicit)
        parent  = SubDir("subdir")           # relative to current working directory (implicit)
        parent  = SubDir("/tmp/subdir")      # absolute path (linux)
        parent  = SubDir("C:/temp/subdir")   # absolute path (windows)
        parent  = SubDir("")                 # current working directory
        
    Sub-directories can be generated in a number of ways::

        subDir = parent('subdir')              # using __call__
        subDir = SubDir('subdir', parent)      # explicit constructor
        subDir = SubDir('subdir', parent="!/") # explicit constructor with parent being a string

    Files managed by ``SubDir`` will usually have the same extension.
    This extension can be specified with ``ext``, or as part of the directory string::
        
        subDir = SubDir("~/subdir", ext="bin") # set extension to 'bin'
        subDir = SubDir("~/subdir;*.bin")      # set extension to 'bin'
                 
    Leaving the extension as default ``None`` allows ``SubDir`` to automatically use
    the extension associated with any specified format.

    **Copy Constructor**

    The constructor is shallow.

    **File I/O**

    Write data with :meth:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.write`::

        subDir.write('item3',item3)          # explicit
        subDir['item1'] = item1              # dictionary style

    Note that :meth:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.write` can write to multiple files at the same time.

    Read data with :meth:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.read`::

        item = subDir('item', 'i1')          # returns 'i1' if not found.
        item = subdir.read('item')           # returns None if not found
        item = subdir.read('item','i2')      # returns 'i2' if not found
        item = subDir['item']                # raises a KeyError if not found

    Treat files in a directory like dictionaries::

        for file in subDir:
            data = subDir[file]
            f(item, data)

        for file, data in subDir.items():
            f(item, data)

    Delete items::

        del subDir['item']                    # silently fails if 'item' does not exist
        subDir.delete('item')                 # silently fails if 'item' does not exist
        subDir.delete('item', True)           # raises a KeyError if 'item' does not exit

    Cleaning up::

        parent.delete_all_content()        # silently deletes all files with matching extensions, and sub directories.

    **File Format**

    ``SubDir`` supports a number of file formats via :class:`cdxcore.subdir.Format`.
    Those can be controlled with the ``fmt`` keyword in various functions not least
    :class:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir`::

        subdir = SubDir("!/.test", fmt=SubDir.JSON_PICKLE)

    See :class:`cdxcore.subdir.Format` for supported formats.
    
    **Polars**
    
    A ``SubDir`` can read and write :class:`polars.DataFrame` if the format is set to :attr:`cdxcore.subdir.Format.POLARS_PARQUET`::
        
        import polars as pl
        import numpy as np
        from cdxcore.subdir import SubDir
        
        x = np.linspace(0,1,5)
        y = np.sin(x)
        df = pl.DataFrame({"x":pl.Series(x,pl.Float32), "y":pl.Series(y,pl.Float32)})
        
        sub = SubDir("!/polars", fmt=SubDir.POLARS_PARQUET)
        sub.write("test", df)
        r = sub.read("test", raise_on_error=True)
        assert np.all(r == df)

    Version handling is supported with parquet files.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str:
        Name of the directory.
        
        The name may start with any of the following special characters:

        * ``'.'`` for current directory.
        * ``'~'`` for home directory.
        * ``'!'`` for system default temp directory. Note that outside any administator imposed policies, sub directories 
          of ``!`` are permanent.
        * ``'?'`` for a temporary temp directory; see :meth:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.temp_temp_dir` regarding semantics.
                    Most importantly, every ``SubDir`` will be constructed with a different (truly) temporary sub directory.
                    If used, ``delete_everything_upon_exit`` is always ``True``.
 
        The directory name may also contain a formatting string for defining ``ext`` on the fly:
        for example use ``"!/test;*.bin"`` to specify a directory ``"test"`` in the user's
        temp directory with extension ``"bin"``.
        
        The directory name can be set to ``None`` in which case it is always empty
        and attempts to write to it fail with  :class:`EOFError`.
        
    parent : str | SubDir | None, default ``None``
        Parent directory. 
        
        If ``parent`` is a :class:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir` then its parameters are used
        as default values.
        
    ext : str | None, default ``None``
        Extension for files managed by this ``SubDir``. All files managed by ``self`` will share the same extension.

        If set to ``""`` no extension is assigned to this directory. That mean that
        all files are considered. For example,
        :meth:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.files` then returns all files contained in the directory, not
        just files with a specific extension.
        
        If ``ext`` is ``None``, then use ``parent.ext`` or if ``parent`` was provided, or otherwise
        the extension defined by ``fmt``:
            
        * 'pck' for the default PICKLE format.
        * 'json' for JSON_PLAIN.
        * 'jpck' for JSON_PICKLE.
        * 'zbsc' for BLOSC.
        * 'pgz' for GZIP.
        * 'prq' for POLARS_PARQUET.
        
    fmt : :class:`cdxcore.subdir.Format` | None, default ``Format.PICKLE``

        One of the :class:`cdxcore.subdir.Format` codes.
        
        If ``ext`` is left to ``None`` and ``parent`` is ``None`` 
        then setting the a format will also set the corrsponding ``ext``.

    create_directory : bool | None, default ``False``
    
        Whether to create the directory upon creation of the ``SubDir`` object; otherwise it will be created upon first
        :meth:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.write`.
        
        Set to ``None`` to use the setting of the parent directory, or ``False`` if no parent
        is specified.

    cache_controller : :class:`cdxcore.subdir.CacheController` | None, default ``None``
    
        An object which fine-tunes the behaviour of :meth:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.cache`.
        See :class:`cdxcore.subdir.CacheController` documentation for further details. 

    delete_everything : bool, default ``False``
    
        Delete all contents in the newly defined sub directory upon creation.
        
    delete_everything_upon_exit : bool, default ``False``
    
        Delete all contents of the current exist if ``self`` is deleted.
        This is the always ``True`` if the ``"?/"`` pretext was used.
        
        Note, however, that this will only be executed once the object is garbage collected.

        Default is, for some good reason, is ``False``.

                ...
            finally:
                shutil.rmtree(tmp_dir)

        """
        Read data from a file if the file exists, or return ``default``.

        * Supports ``file`` containing directory information.
        * Supports ``file`` (and ``default``as well as ``ext``) being iterable.
          Examples::
              
            from cdxcore.subdir import SubDir
            files = ['file1', 'file2']
            sd = SubDir("!/test")

            sd.read( files )          # both files are using default None
            sd.read( files, 1 )       # both files are using default '1'
            sd.read( files, [1,2] )   # files use defaults 1 and 2, respectively

            sd.read( files, [1] )      # produces error as len(keys) != len([1])

          Strings are iterable but are treated as single value.
          Therefore::
              
            sd.read( files, '12' )      # the default value '12' is used for both files
            sd.read( files, ['1','2'] ) # use defaults '1' and '2', respectively

        Parameters
        ----------
        file : str
            A file name or a list thereof. ``file`` may contain subdirectories.
            
        default :
            Default value, or default values if ``file`` is a list.
            
        raise_on_error : bool, default ``False``
            Whether to raise an exception if reading an existing file failed.
            By default this function fails silently and returns the default.
            
        version : str | None, default ``None``
            If not ``None``, specifies the version of the current code base.
            
            In this case, this version will be compared to the version of the file being read.
            If they do not match, read fails (either by returning default or throwing a :class:`cdxcore.version.VersionError` exception).

            You can specify version ``"*"`` to accept any version.
            Note that this is distinct
            to using ``None`` which stipulates that the file should not 
            have version information.
            
        delete_wrong_version : bool, default ``True``
            If ``True``, and if a wrong version was found, delete the file.

        ext : str | None, default ``None``
            Extension overwrite, or a list thereof if ``file`` is a list.
            
            Use:
                
            * ``None`` to use directory's default.
            * ``'*'`` to use the extension implied by ``fmt``.
            * ``""`` to turn of extension management.
            
        fmt : :class:`cdxcore.subdir.Format` | None, default ``None``
            File :class:`cdxcore.subdir.Format` or ``None`` to use the directory's default.
            
            Note:
                
            * ``fmt`` cannot be a list even if ``file`` is.
            * Unless ``ext`` or the SubDir's extension is ``'*'``, changing the format does not automatically change the extension.

        Returns
        -------
        Content : type | list
            For a single ``file`` returns the content of the file if successfully read, or ``default`` otherwise.
            If ``file`` is a list, this function returns a list of contents.
                
        Raises
        ------
        Version error : :class:`cdxcore.version.VersionError`:
            If the file's version did not match the ``version`` provided.
            
        Version present : :class:`cdxcore.subdir.VersionPresentError`:
            When attempting to read a file without ``version`` which has a version this exception is raised.
            
        I/O errors : ``Exception``
            Various standard I/O errors are raisedas usual.

        Parameters
        ----------
            element : str | None
                File or directory name, or a list thereof.

                ``element`` can be ``None`` if ``default`` is left at its dummy value ``SubDir.RET_SUB_DIR`` (the default)
                in which case ``__call__`` refers to the current directory.
                
            default : Any, default ``SubDir.RET_SUB_DIR``
                If specified, this function reads ``element`` with
                ``read( element, default, *args, **kwargs )``.

                If ``default`` is not specified and left at the dummy value ``SubDir.RET_SUB_DIR``, then this function returns a new sub-directory by calling
                ``SubDir(element,parent=self,ext=ext,fmt=fmt)``.

            create_directory : bool, default ``None``
                *When creating sub-directories:*
                
                Whether or not to instantly create the sub-directory. The default, ``None``, is to inherit the behaviour from ``self``.
                
            raise_on_error : bool, default ``False``
                *When reading files:*
                
                Whether to raise an exception if reading an existing file failed.
                By default this function fails silently and returns ``default``.
                
            version : str | None, default ``None``
                *When reading files:*
                
                If not ``None``, specifies the version of the current code base.
                
                In this case, this version will be compared to the version of the file being read.
                If they do not match, read fails (either by returning default or throwing a :class:`cdxcore.version.VersionError` exception).

                You can specify version ``"*"`` to accept any version.
                Note that this is distinct
                to using ``None`` which stipulates that the file should not 
                have version information.

            delete_wrong_version : bool, default ``True``.
                *When reading files:*
                
                If ``True``, and if a wrong version was found, delete the file.

            ext : str | None, default is ``None``.
                *When reading files:*
                
                Extension to be used, or a list thereof if ``element`` is a list. Defaults
                to the extension of ``self``.
                
                Semantics:
                    
                * ``None`` to use the default extension of ``self``.
                * ``"*"`` to use the extension implied by ``fmt``.
                * ``""`` to turn off extension management.

                *When creating sub-directories:*
                
                Extension for the new subdirectory; set to ``None`` to inherit the parent's extension.

            fmt : :class:`cdxcore.subdir.Format` | None, default ``None``
                *When reading files:*
                
                File format or ``None`` to use the directory's default.
                Note that ``fmt`` cannot be a list even if ``element`` is.
                Unless 
                ``ext`` or the SubDir's extension is ``"*"``, changing the
                format does not automatically change the extension.

                *When creating sub-directories:*
                
                Format for the new sub-directory; set to ``None`` to inherit the parent's format.

        Advanced versioned caching for callables.
        
        Versioned caching is based on the following two simple principles:
            
        1) **Unique Call IDs:**

           When a function is called with some parameters, the wrapper identifies a unique ID based
           on the qualified name of the function and on its runtime functional parameters (ie those
           which alter the outcome of the function).
           When a function is called the first time with a given unique call ID, it will store
           the result of the call to disk. If the function is called with the same call ID again,
           the result is read from disk and returned.

           To compute unique call IDs :class:`cdxcore.uniquehash.NamedUniqueHash` is used
           by default.

        2) **Code Version:**
    
           Each function has a version, which includes dependencies on other functions or classes.
           If the version of data on disk does not match the current version, it is deleted
           and the generating function is called again. This way you can use your code to drive updates
           to data generated with cached functions.               
           
           Behind the scenes this is implemented using :dec:`cdxcore.version.version` which means
           that the version of a cached function can also depend on versions of non-cached functions
           or other objects.
           
        Caching Functions
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Caching a simple function ``f`` is staight forward:

        .. code-block:: python

            from cdxcore.subdir import SubDir
            cache   = SubDir("!/.cache")
            cache.delete_all_content()   # for illustration
            
            @cache.cache("0.1")
            def f(x,y):
                return x*y
            
            _ = f(1,2)    # function gets computed and the result cached
            _ = f(1,2)    # restore result from cache
            _ = f(2,2)    # different parameters: compute and store result

        Cache another function ``g`` which calls ``f``, and whose version therefore on ``f``'s version:
        
        .. code-block:: python

            @cache.cache("0.1", dependencies=[f])
            def g(x,y):
                return g(x,y)**2

        **Debugging**
        
        When using automated caching it
        is important to understand how changes in parameters and the version of the a function
        affect caching. To this end, :dec:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.cache` supports
        a tracing mechanism via the use of a :class:`cdxcore.subdir.CacheController`:

        .. code-block:: python

            from cdxcore.subdir import SubDir, CacheController, Context
            
            ctrl    = CacheController( debug_verbose=Context("all") )
            cache   = SubDir("!/.cache", cache_controller=ctrl )
            cache.delete_all_content()   # <- delete previous cached files, for this example only
            
            @cache.cache("0.1")
            def f(x,y):
                return x*y
            
            _ = f(1,2)    # function gets computed and the result cached
            _ = f(1,2)    # restore result from cache
            _ = f(2,2)    # different parameters: compute and store result
            
        Returns:

        .. code-block:: python
            
            00: cache(f@__main__): function registered for caching into 'C:/Users/hans/AppData/Local/Temp/.cache/'.
            00: cache(f@__main__): called 'f@__main__' version 'version 0.1' and wrote result into 'C:/Users/hans/AppData/Local/Temp/.cache/f@__main__ 668a6b111549e288.pck'.
            00: cache(f@__main__): read 'f@__main__' version 'version 0.1' from cache 'C:/Users/hans/AppData/Local/Temp/.cache/f@__main__ 668a6b111549e288.pck'.
            00: cache(f@__main__): called 'f@__main__' version 'version 0.1' and wrote result into 'C:/Users/hans/AppData/Local/Temp/.cache/f@__main__ b5609542d7da0b04.pck'.
            
        **Non-Functional Parameters**

        A function may have non-functional parameters which do not alter the function's outcome.
        An example are ``debug`` flags:

        .. code-block:: python
                         
            from cdxcore.subdir import SubDir
            cache   = SubDir("!/.cache")

            @cache.cache("0.1", dependencies=[f], exclude_args='debug')
            def g(x,y,debug): # <--' 'debug' is a non-functional parameter
                if debug:
                    print(f"h(x={x},y={y})")  
                return g(x,y)**2
                         
        You can define certain types as non-functional for *all* functions wrapped
        by :meth:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.cache` when construcing
        the :class:`cdxcore.cache.CacheController` parameter for in :class:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir`:
        
        .. code-block:: python

            from cdxcore.subdir import SubDir
            
            class Debugger:
                def output( cond, message ):
                    print(message)
            
            ctrl    = CacheController(exclude_arg_types=[Debugger])   # <- exclude 'Debugger' parameters from hasing
            cache   = SubDir("!/.cache")

            @cache.cache("0.1", dependencies=[f])
            def g(x,y,debugger : Debugger): # <-- 'debugger' is a non-functional parameter
                debugger.output(f"h(x={x},y={y})")  
                return g(x,y)**2
            
        **Unique IDs and File Naming**
                         
        The *unique call ID of a decorated function* is by logicaly generated by its fully qualified name
        and a unique hash of its functional parameters.
        
        By default, :class:`cdxcore.uniquehash.NamedUniqueHash` is used to compute unique hashes.
        Key default behaviours of :class:`cdxcore.uniquehash.NamedUniqueHash`:
            
        * :class:`cdxcore.uniquehash.NamedUniqueHash` hashes objects via their ``__dict__`` or ``__slot__`` members.
          This can be overwritten for a class by implementing ``__unique_hash__``; see :class:`cdxcore.uniquehash.NamedUniqueHash`.
          
        * Function members of objects or any members starting with '_' are not hashed
          unless this behaviour is changed using :class:`cdxcore.subdir.CacheController`.
          
        * Numpy and panda frames are hashed using their byte representation.
          That is slow and not recommended. It is better to identify numpy/panda inputs
          via their generating characteristic ID.
                           
        Either way, hashes are not particularly human readable. It is often useful
        to have unique IDs and therefore filenames which carry some context information.
        
        This can be achieved by using ``label``:

        .. code-block:: python

            from cdxcore.subdir import SubDir, CacheController
            ctrl    = CacheController( debug_verbose=Context("all") )
            cache   = SubDir("!/.cache", cache_controller=ctrl )
            cache.delete_all_content()   # for illustration
            
            @cache.cache("0.1")                     # <- no ID 
            def f1(x,y):
                return x*y
            
            @cache.cache("0.1", label="f2({x},{y})") # <- label uses a string to be passed to str.format()
            def f2(x,y):
                return x*y
            
        We can also use a function to generate a ``label``. In that case all parameters
        to the function including its ``func_name`` are passed to the function.::

            @cache.cache("0.1", label=lambda x,y: f"h({x},{y})", exclude_args='debug') 
            def h(x,y,debug=False):
                if debug:
                    print(f"h(x={x},y={y})")  
                return x*y

        We obtain:

        .. code-block:: python

            f1(1,1)
            f2(1,1)
            h(1,1)        
            
            00: cache(f1@__main__): function registered for caching into 'C:/Users/hans/AppData/Local/Temp/.cache/'.
            00: cache(f2@__main__): function registered for caching into 'C:/Users/hans/AppData/Local/Temp/.cache/'.
            00: cache(h@__main__): function registered for caching into 'C:/Users/hans/AppData/Local/Temp/.cache/'.
            00: cache(f1@__main__): called 'f1@__main__' version 'version 0.1' and wrote result into 'C:/Users/hans/AppData/Local/Temp/.cache/f1@__main__ ef197d80d6a0bbb0.pck'.
            00: cache(f2@__main__): called 'f2(1,1)' version 'version 0.1' and wrote result into 'C:/Users/hans/AppData/Local/Temp/.cache/f2(1,1) bdc3cd99157c10f7.pck'.
            00: cache(h@__main__): called 'h(1,1)' version 'version 0.1' and wrote result into 'C:/Users/hans/AppData/Local/Temp/.cache/h(1,1) d3fdafc9182070f4.pck'.            

        Note that the file names ``f2(1,1) bdc3cd99157c10f7.pck``
        and ``h(1,1) d3fdafc9182070f4.pck`` for the ``f2`` and ``h`` function calls are now easier to read as
        they are comprised of the label
        of the function and a terminal hash key.
        The trailing hash is appended because we do not assume that the label returned by ``label`` is unique.
        Therefore, a hash generated from all the ``label`` itself and
        all pertinent arguments will be appended to the filename.
        
        If we know how to generate truly unique IDs which are always valid filenames, then we can use ``uid``
        instead of ``label``:
        
        .. code-block:: python

            @cache.cache("0.1", uid=lambda x,y: f"h2({x},{y})", exclude_args='debug') 
            def h2(x,y,debug=False):
                if debug:
                    print(f"h(x={x},y={y})")  
                return x*y
            h2(1,1)
            
        yields::
            
            00: cache(h2@__main__): function registered for caching into 'C:/Users/hans/AppData/Local/Temp/.cache/'.
            00: cache(h2@__main__): called 'h2(1,1)' version 'version 0.1' and wrote result into 'C:/Users/hans/AppData/Local/Temp/.cache/h2(1,1).pck'.            
            
        In particular, the filename is now ``h2(1,1).pck`` without any hash.
        If ``uid`` is used the parameter of the function are not hashed. Like ``label`` 
        the parameter ``uid`` can also be a :meth:`str.format` string or a callable.
            
        **Controlliong which Parameters to Hash**
            
        To specify which parameters are pertinent for identifying a unique ID, use:
            
        * ``include_args``: list of functions arguments to include. If ``None``, use all parameteres as input in the next step
        
        * ``exclude_args``: list of function arguments to exclude, if not ``None``.
        
        * ``exclude_arg_types``: a list of types or names of type to exclude.
          This is helpful if control flow is managed with dedicated data types.
          An example of such a type is :class:`cdxcore.verbose.Context` which is used to print hierarchical output messages.
          Types can be globally excluded using a :class:`cdxcore.subdir.CacheController`
          when calling
          :class:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir`.
                       
        **Numpy/Pandas**

        Numpy/Panda data should not be hashed for identifying unique call IDs.
        Instead, use the defining characteristics for generating the data frames.
        
        For example:

        .. code-block:: python
            
            from cdxcore.pretty import PrettyObject
            from cdxcore.subdir import SubDir
            cache   = SubDir("!/.cache")
            cache.delete_all_content()   # for illustration
            
            @cache.cache("0.1")
            def load_src( src_def ):
                result = ... load ...
                return result

            # ignore 'src_result'. It is uniquely identified by 'src_def' -->
            @cache.cache("0.1", dependencies=[load_src], exclude_args=['data'])  
            def statistics( stats_def, src_def, data ):
                stats = ... using data
                return stats
            
            src_def = PrettyObject()
            src_def.start = "2010-01-01"
            src_def.end = "2025-01-01"
            src_def.x = 0.1

            stats_def = PrettyObject()
            stats_def.lambda = 0.1
            stats_def.window = 100

            data  = load_src( src_def )
            stats = statistics( stats_def, src_def, data )

        While instructive, this case is not optimal: we do not really need to load ``data``
        if we can reconstruct ``stats`` from ``data`` (unless we need ``data`` further on).
        
        Consider therefore:

        .. code-block:: python

            @cache.cache("0.1")
            def load_src( src_def ):
                result = ... load ...
                return result

            # ignore 'src_result'. It is uniquely identified by 'src_def' -->
            @cache.cache("0.1", dependencies=[load_src])  
            def statistics_only( stats_def, src_def ):
                data  = load_src( src_def )    # <-- embedd call to load_src() here
                stats = ... using src_result
                return stats
            
            stats = statistics_only( stats_def, src_def )

        Caching Member Functions
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        You can cache member functions like any other function.
        Note that :dec:`cdxcore.version.version` information are by default inherited, i.e. member functions will be dependent on the version of their 
        defining class, and class versions will be dependent on their base classes' versions:
            
        .. code-block:: python

            from cdxcore.subdir import SubDir, version
            cache   = SubDir("!/.cache")
            cache.delete_all_content()   # for illustration
            
            @version("0.1")
            class A(object):
                def __init__(self, x):
                    self.x = x

                @cache.cache("0.1")
                def f(self, y):
                    return self.x*y
        
            a = A(x=1)
            _ = a.f(y=1)   # compute f and store result
            _ = a.f(y=1)   # load result back from disk
            a.x = 2
            _ = a.f(y=1)   # 'a' changed: compute f and store result
            b = A(x=2)
            _ = b.f(y=1)   # same unique call ID as previous call
                           # -> restore result from disk
            
        **WARNING:**

        :class:`cdxcore.uniquehash.UniqueHash` does *not* by default process members of objects or dictionaries
        which start with a "_". This behaviour can be changed using :class:`cdxcore.subdir.CacheController`.
        For reasonably complex objects it is recommended to implement for your objects 
        the a custom hashing function::
        
            __unique_hash__( self, uniqueHash : UniqueHash, debug_trace : DebugTrace  )

        This function is described at :class:`cdxcore.uniquehash.UniqueHash`.
            
        Caching Bound Member Functions
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        Caching bound member functions is technically quite different to caching a function of a class in general,
        but also supported:
            
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from cdxcore.subdir import SubDir, version
            cache   = SubDir("!/.cache", cache_controller =
                             CacheController(debug_verbose=Context("all")))
            cache.delete_all_content()   # for illustration

            class A(object):
                def __init__(self,x):
                    self.x = x
                def f(self,y):
                    return self.x*y
            
            a = A(x=1)
            f = cache.cache("0.1", uid=lambda self, y : f"a.f({y})")(a.f)  # <- decorate bound 'f'.
            r = c(y=2)

        In this case the function ``f`` is bound to ``a``. The object is added as ``self`` to the function
        parameter list even though the bound function parameter list does not include ``self``.
        This, together with the comments on hashing objects above, ensures that (hashed) changes to ``a`` will
        be reflected in the unique call ID for the member function.

        Managing Caching Accross a Project
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        For project-wide use it is usually convenient to control caching at the level of a 
        project-wide cache root directory.
        The classs :class:`cdxcore.subdir.VersionedCacheRoot` is a thin convenience wrapper around a :class:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir`
        with a :class:`cdxcore.subdir.CacheController`.
        
        The idea is to have a central file, ``cache.py`` which contains the central root for caching.
        We recommend using an environment variable to be able to control the location of this directory
        out side the code. Here is an example with an environment variable ``PROJECT_CACHE_DIR``::
            
            # file cache.py
            
            from cdxcore.subdir import VersionedCacheRoot
            import os as os
                        
            cache_root = VersionedCacheRoot(
                               os.getenv("PROJECT_CACHE_DIR", "!/.cache")
                               )

        In a particular project file, say ``pipeline.py`` create a file-local cache directory
        and use it::
            
            # file pipeline.py
            
            from cache import cache_root
            
            cache_dir = cache_root("pipeline")
            
            @cache_dir.cache("0.1")
            def f(x):
                return x+2
            
            @cache_dir.cache("0.1", dependencies=[f])
            def g(x)
                return f(x)**2
            
            # ...
            
        In case you have issues with caching you can use the central root directory to turn on tracing 
        accross your project:

        .. code-block:: python
           :emphasize-lines: 4

            from cdxcore.verbose import Context
            cache_root = VersionedCacheRoot(
                               os.getenv("PROJECT_CACHE_DIR", "!/.cache"),
                               debug_verbose=Context.all    # turn full traing on
                            )

        Parameters
        ----------
        version : str | None, default ``None``
            Version of the function.
            
            * If ``None`` then a common ``F`` must be decorated manually 
              ith :dec:`cdxcore.version.version`.
            * If set, the function ``F`` is automatically first decorated
              with :dec:`cdxcore.version.version` for you.
            
        dependencies : list[type] | None, default ``None``
            A list of version dependencies, either by reference or by name.
            See :dec:`cdxcore.version.version` for details on
            name lookup if strings are used.
        
        label : str | Callable | None, default ``None``
            Specify a human-readable label for the function call given its parameters.
            
            This label is used to generate the cache file name, and is also printed in when tracing
            hashing operations. Labels are not assumed to be unique, hence a unique hash of
            the label and the parameters to this function will be appended to generate
            the actual cache file name.
            
            Use ``uid`` instead if ``label`` represents valid unique filenames. You cannot specify both ``uid`` and ``label``.
            If neither ``uid`` and ``label`` are present, ``name`` will be used.
            
            A ``label`` can start with a directory, i.e. ``lablel : lambda x, y : f"x/y"`` is a valid pattern.
            
            **Usage:**
            
            * If ``label`` is a ``Callable`` then ``label( func_name=name, **parameters )`` will be called
              to generate the actual label.
              
              The parameter ``func_name`` refers to the qualified
              name of the function. Its value can be overwitten by ``name``, while the parameter name itself
              can be overwritten using ``name_of_func_name_arg``, see below.

            * If ``label`` is a plain string without ``{}`` formatting: use this string as-is.
            
            * If ``label`` is a string with ``{}`` formatting, then ``label.format( func_name=name, **parameters )``
              will be used to generate the actual label. 
              
              The parameter ``func_name`` refers to the qualified
              name of the function. Its value can be overwitten by ``name``, while the parameter name itself
              can be overwritten using ``name_of_func_name_arg``, see below.
            
            See above for examples.
            
            ``label`` cannot be used alongside ``uid``.
            
        uid : str | Callable | None, default ``None``
            Alternative to ``label`` which is assumed to generate a unique cache file name. It has the same
            semantics as ``label``. When used, parameters to the decorated function are not hashed
            as the ``uid`` is assumed to be already unique. The string must be a valid file name

            A ``uid`` can start with a directory.
            
            Use ``label`` if the id is not unique. You cannot specify both ``uid`` and ``label``.
            If neither ``uid`` and ``label`` are present, ``name`` will be used (as non-unique ``label``).
        
        name : str | None, default ``None``
            Name of this function which is used either on its own if neither ``label`` not ``uid`` are used,
            or which passed as a parameter ``func_name`` to either the callable or the
            formatting operator. See above for more details.
            
            If ``name`` is not specified it defaults to ``__qualname__`` expanded
            by the module name the function is defined in.
        
        include_args : list[str] | None, default ``None``
            List of arguments to include in generating an unqiue ID, or ``None`` for all.
        
        exclude_args : list[str] | None, default ``None``
            List of arguments to exclude from generating an unique ID. Examples of such non-functional arguments
            are workflow controls (debugging) and i/o elements.
            
        exclude_arg_types : list[type | str] | None, default ``None``
            List of parameter types or names of type to exclude from generating an unique ID. Examples of such non-functional arguments
            are workflow controls (debugging) and i/o elements. Strings are compated to ``type(arg).__name__``.

        in_sub_dir : str | Callable | None, default ``None``
            Allows specifying a sub-directory for the cached files, using the same formatting logic as for ``label``.
            
        version_auto_class : bool, default ``True``
            Whether to automaticallty add version dependencies on base classes or, for member functions, on containing
            classes. This is the ``auto_class`` parameter for :dec:`cdxcore.version.version`.
            
        name_of_func_name_arg : str, default ``"func_name"``
            When formatting ``label`` or ``uid``, by default ``"func_name"`` is used to refer to the current
            function name. If there is already a parameter ``func_name`` for the function, an error will be raised.
            Use this flag to change the parameter name. Example::

                from cdxcore.subdir import SubDir
                cache = SubDir("?/temp")

                @cache.cache("0.1")
                def f( func_name, x ):
                    pass
                
                f("test", 1)
                
            Generates a :class:`RuntimeError` ``f@__main__: 'func_name' is a reserved keyword
            and used as formatting parameter
            name for the function name. Found it also in the function parameter list. Use 'name_of_name_arg' to change the internal parameter name used.``.

            Instead, use:            
            
            .. code-block:: python

                @cache.cache("0.1", x : f"{new_func_name}(): {func_name} {x}", 
                                    name_of_func_name_arg="new_func_name")
                def f( func_name, x ):
                    pass

        Returns
        -------
        Decorated F: Callable
        
            A decorated ``F`` whose ``__call__`` implements the cached call to ``F``.
            
            This decorator has a member ``cache_info``
            of type :class:`cdxcore.subdir.CacheInfo`
            which can be used to access information on caching activity.

            * Information available at any time after decoration:
                
              * ``F.cache_info.name`` : qualified name of the function
              * ``F.cache_info.signature`` : signature of the function
        
            * Additonal information available during a call to a decorated function ``F``, and thereafter
              (these proprties are not thread-safe):
                
              * ``F.cache_info.version`` : unique version string reflecting all dependencies.
              * ``F.cache_info.filename`` : unique filename used for caching logic during the last function call.
              * ``F.cache_info.label`` : last label generated, or ``None``.
              * ``F.cache_info.arguments`` : arguments parsed to create a unique call ID, or ``None``.

            * Additonal information available after a call to ``F`` (these proprties are not thread-safe):
                
              * ``F.cache_info.last_cached`` : whether the last function call returned a cached object.
                
            The decorated ``F()`` has additional function parameters, namely:
                
            * ``override_cache_mode`` : ``CacheMode`` | None, default ``None``
            
              Allows overriding the ``CacheMode`` temporarily, in particular you can set it to ``"off"``.
               
            * ``track_cached_files`` : :class:`cdxcore.subdir.CacheTracker` | None, default ``None``
            
              Allows passing a :class:`cdxcore.subdir.CacheTracker`
              object to keep track of all
              files used (loaded from or saved to). 
              The function :meth:`cdxcore.subdir.CacheTracker.delete_cache_files` can be used
              to delete all files involved in caching.

            * ``return_cache_uid`` : bool, default ``False``
            
              If ``True``, then the decorated function will return a tuple ``uid, result``
              where ``uid`` is the unique filename generated for this function call,
              and where ``result`` is the actual result from the function, cached or not.
              This ``uid`` is thread-safe.
              
              Usage::
                  
                  from cdxcore.subdir import SubDir
                  cache_dir = SubDir("!/.cache")

                  uid, xy = f( x=1, y=2, return_cache_uid=True )
                  
              This pattern is thread-safe when compared to using::
              
                  xy = f( x=1, y=2 )
                  uid = f.cache_info.filename

    Create a root directory for versioned caching on disk
    using :dec:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.cache`.
    
    **Usage:**

    In a central file, define a root directory for all caching activity::
        
        from cdxcore.subdir import VersionedCacheRoot
        vroot = VersionedCacheRoot("!/cache")

    Parameters
    ----------
    directory : str
        Name of the root directory for caching.
        
        Using SubDir the following Short-cuts are supported:
            
        * ``"!/dir"`` creates ``dir`` in the temporary directory.
        * ``"~/dir"`` creates ``dir`` in the home directory.
        * ``"./dir"`` creates ``dir`` relative to the current directory.
        
    ext : str | None, default ``None``
        Extension, which will automatically be appended to file names.
        The default value depends on ``fmt`; for ``Format.PICKLE`` it is "pck".
        
    fmt : :class:`cdxcore.subdir.Format` | None, default ``None``
        File format; if ``ext`` is not specified, the format drives the extension, too.
        The default ``None`` becomes ``Format.PICKLE``.

    create_directory : bool, default ``False``
        Whether to create the directory upon creation.

            Cached execution of the wrapped function ``F`` with additional functionality.
            
            Once the function returns :attr:`cdxcore.subdir._CacheWrapper.cache_info`
            contains pertinent information regarding caching, for example
            if the result returned by this function was cached and if so what file
            was used.
            
            Parameters
            ----------
                args : Collection
                    Keyword arguments for the cached function F.
                    
                kwargs : Collection
                    Keyword arguments for the cached function F.
                    
                override_cache_mode : :class:`cdxcore.subdir.CacheMode` | None, default ``None
                    Changes the caching mode for this function call.
                    For example you can force re-computation by passing ``update``.
    
                track_cached_files : :class:`cdxcore.subdir.CacheTracker` | None, default ``None
                    Allows tracking all cached files - for example for mass deletion.
                    
                return_cache_uid : bool, default ``False``
                    If ``True``, then this function returns not only the result
                    of ``F``, the tuple ``unique_id, result``. This is a thread-safe
                    method of obtaining a ``unique_id`` for a given function call.
                    
                cache_generate_only : bool, default ``False``
                    When ``True`` the function will return a status indicator whether the cached function was called.
                    It therefore returns:
                     
                    * ``False`` if the object this function
                       would compute exists with the correct version (without loading much of it from disk). 
                    * ``True`` if the object does not exist, or has the wrong version, it is re-computed and
                       stored on disk.

                    Using this keyword is an efficient method to generate a list of all objects that would be generated by a function call, without actually loading them from disk.

                    Under the hood this function calls :meth:`cdxcore.subdir.SubDir.is_version`
                    which is a fast operation even for large files.

                Result : Any
                    Return from the function ``F(*args,**kwargs)``, cached or not.
                    
                filename, Result : Any
                    Return from the function ``F(*args,**kwargs)``, cached or not.
