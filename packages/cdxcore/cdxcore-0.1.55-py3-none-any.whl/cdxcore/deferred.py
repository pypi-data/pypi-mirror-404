Overview
--------

Framework for delayed execution of a Python code tree.
Used by :mod:`cdxcore.dynaplot`.

Illustation
^^^^^^^^^^^

**The Top Dependency Graph**

Assume we have a class ``A`` and a function ``F``
operates on instances ``a`` of ``A``:

.. code-block:: python

    class A(object):
        def __init__(self, x):
            self.x = x
        def func(self, y=1):
            return self.x * y
        def __call__(self, y):
            return self.x + y
        def __eq__(self, z):
            return self.x==z

    def F(a : A):       
        _ = a.f(2)
        _ = _+a(3)  
        return _, _ == 1
    
Create execution means that instead of using an instance of ``A`` to evaluate
``F``, we use a :func:`cdxcore.deferred.Deferred.Create` object:

.. code-block:: python

    from cdxcore.deferred import Create
    
    a      = Create("a")    # <- name "a" is arbitrary but important for error messages
    r1, r2 = F(a)
    
The returned ``r1`` and ``r2`` are of type :class:`cdxcore.deferred.Deferred`. We can print
the overall dependency tree from ``a`` using :meth:`cdxcore.deferred.Deferred.deferred_print_dependency_tree`:

.. code-block:: python
    
    a.deferred_print_dependency_tree( with_sources = True )
    
yields::

    00: $a <= $a
    01:   $a.f <= $a
    02:     $a.f(2) <= $a
    03:       ($a.f(2)+$a(3)) <= $a
    04:         (($a.f(2)+$a(3))==1) <= $a
    01:   $a(3) <= $a

The ``$`` sign indicates top level source elements.
Note that this tree shows the depth of the dependencies, not execution dependencies: the term ``$a(3)``
must be executed before ``$a.f(2)+=$a(3)``.
This order of terms a seen from the top level ``a`` can be retrieved using :meth:`cdxcore.deferred.Deferred.deferred_source_dependants`:
calling ``print( [ _.deferred_info for _ in a.deferred_source_dependants ] )`` prints::

    ['$a.f', '$a.f(2)', '$a(3)', '$a.f(2)+=$a(3)', '($a.f(2)==2)']

**Evaluating the Graph**

To execute the graph, use :meth:`cdxcore.deferred.Create.deferred_resolve` at top level (note that graphs can only
be resolved once):

.. code-block:: python

    a.deferred_resolve(A(x=2))
    print(r1.deferred_result, ",", r2.deferred_result)   # -> 9 , False
    
Validation by directly execution ``F`` with an object of type ``A`` confirms the result:

.. code-block:: python

    t1, t2 = F(A(x=2))
    print(t1, ",", t2)                                 # -> 9 , False

Limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^

The framework relies on replacing any Python element by a :class:`cdxcore.deferred.Deferred` object and then
catche and track all actions applied to it, be that reading an attribute, an item, calling ``__call__`` or accessing
any of the standard Python attributes such as ``__eq__``.

This appraoch has a number of short comings:

* **Gap in Implementation:** please let us know.    

* **Flow controls:** any code flow which depends on the actual value of some computation is not supported.

* **Core Python Operators:** some Python operators
  must return a certain type: ``__bool__``, ``__str__``, ``__repr__`` and ``__index__`` as far as we are aware.
  That means we cannot wrap the result into a 
  :class:`cdxcore.deferred.Deferred`.
  
  Considering ``__str__`` and ``__repr__`` are used throughtout the Python stack 
  a ``Deferred`` will return strings describing itself. Be aware of
  corresponding error messages.
  
  If ``__bool__`` or ``__index__`` is called a :class:`cdxcore.deferred.NotSupportedError`
  is raised.

* **Python atomic types:** Python optimizes various operations for its atomic types such as ``int`` etc. That means if a deferred
  action catches an operation on an element which represents an atomic element, it might not be able to translate the action
  into the atomic's equivalent.
  
  Here is an example for ``int`` with ``+=``: 
      
  .. code-block:: python
  
      a = Create("a")
      a += 1
      a.deferred_resolve(int(1))      

  This produces an error:

  .. code-block:: python
  
      AttributeError: ("Cannot resolve '$a+=1': the concrete element of type 'int' provided by '$a' does not contain the action '__iadd__'", "'int' object has no attribute '__iadd__'")

  The reason here is that the operation ``a += 1`` was caught as an ``__iadd__`` action.
  However, ``getattr`` cannot obtain this operator from an ``int``:
      
  .. code-block:: python

      getattr( int(1), "__iadd__" )    # -> AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute '__iadd__'

  Interestingly, other operators such as ``__add__`` do work.

**Core Python Elements**

Some Python functionality requires more complexity: catching and tracing core
operatores like ``__bool__``, ``is_`` etc does not add value to the use cases we have in mind, and complicate the framework
considerably.

Deriving your own Classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A common usage pattern is to mix deferred actions with actual actions.
To derive from :func:`cdxcore.deferred.Deferred.Create` it is recommended that you overwrite any operators that your
class relies on, explicitly or implicitly.

For example:
    
* **Equality operator for :class:`list` use:** if you intend to add your objects to a list, then you will need to overwrite
  the `__eq__` operator. The implementation of `Create.__eq__` delegates the result of the equality test to a later point - however
  if you plan to add any objects to a list, then this 

Class Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The class interfaces for both :func:`cdxcore.deferred.Deferred.Create` and :class:`cdxcore.deferred.Deferred`
are pretty clunky in that all member functions and attribues are pre-fixed with ``deferred`` or ``_deferred_``, respectively.
The reason is that the objects will catch and track all member function calls and attribute access meant for objects
of type ``A``.

class Deferred(object):
    r"""
    Create a top level placeholder object to keep track
    of a sequence of actions performed
    on an object that does not yet exist.

    Actions such as function calls, item access, or attribute access,
    feed the resulting logical dependency tree. Once the target
    element is available, execute the dependency tree iteratively.

    A basic example is as follows: assume we have a class ``A`` of which
    we will create an object ``a``, but only at a later stage. We
    wish to record a list of deferred actions on ``a`` ahead of its creation.

    Define the class

    .. code-block:: python
        
        class A(object):
            def __init__(self, x):
                self.x = x
            def a_func(self, y):
                return self.x * y
            @staticmethod
            def a_static(y):
                return y
            @property
            def a_propery(self):
                return self.x
            def __getitem__(self, y):
                return self.x * y
            def __call__(self, y):
                return self.x * y
            def another(self):#
                return A(x=self.x*2)

    Use :func:`cdxcore.deferred.Deferred.Create` to create a root ``Deferred`` object:
        
    .. code-block:: python

        from cdxcore.deferred import Create
        da = Create("A")
        
    Record a few actions:

    .. code-block:: python

        af = da.a_func(1)    # defer function call to a_func(1)
        ai = da[2]           # defer item access
        aa = da.x            # defer attribute access

    :class:`cdxcore.deferred.Deferred` works iteratively, e.g. all values returned from a function call, ``__call__``, or ``__getitem__``
    are themselves deferred automatically. :class:`cdxcore.deferred.Deferred` is also able to defer item and attribute assignments.
    
    As an example:

    .. code-block:: python

        an = da.another()
        an = an.another()     # call a.another().another() --> an.x = 1*2*2 = 4
        
    Finally, resolve the execution by instantiating ``A`` and calling :meth:`cdxcore.deferred.Create.deferred_resolve`:

    .. code-block:: python

        a = A()
        da.deferred_resolve( a )
        
        print( an.x )         # -> 4
