"""
Development-related CLI commands.

This package contains commands for embedded development and debugging:
- debug: Debug firmware and manage debug sessions (flash, reset, gdbserver, etc.)
- arm: Control robotic arm position and movement
- python: Run Python scripts on box hardware
- devenv: Docker-based development environment management

These commands handle debugging, robotic arm control, Python execution,
and development environment management. The debug subpackage includes
specialized service clients and caching for efficient debug operations.
