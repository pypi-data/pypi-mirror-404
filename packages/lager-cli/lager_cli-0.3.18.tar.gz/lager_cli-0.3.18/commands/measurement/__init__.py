Measurement Commands Package

This package groups measurement-related CLI commands:
- adc: Read voltage from ADC net
- dac: Set or read DAC output voltage
- gpi: Read GPIO input state
- gpo: Set GPIO output level
- scope: Control oscilloscope settings
- logic: Control logic analyzer channels and triggers
- thermocouple: Read thermocouple temperature
- watt: Read power from watt meter net

All commands use the consolidated net_helpers module from cli.core for common
functionality including box resolution, net validation, and display formatting.
