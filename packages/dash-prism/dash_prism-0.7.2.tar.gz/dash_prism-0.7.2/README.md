A multi-panel workspace manager for Plotly Dash applications.

**Documentation:** https://ludwigaj.github.io/dash-prism/ · **PyPI:** https://pypi.org/project/dash-prism/

## What is Dash Prism?

Dash Prism provides a unified workspace where multiple Dash layouts coexist as
tabs within resizable, splittable panels. Users arrange their workspace via
drag-and-drop while developers focus on building content.

## The Problem

Building dashboards with Plotly Dash typically means:

- **Fragmented applications** - Each dashboard lives in isolation, requiring
  users to switch between browser tabs or navigate complex menus.
- **Repetitive UI work** - Developers spend time on layout scaffolding, content
  management, and styling instead of business logic.
- **One-size-fits-all layouts** - Users get a fixed arrangement that may not
  match their workflow.
- **No personalization** - Workspaces reset on every visit; users cannot save
  their preferred view.

## The Solution

Dash Prism addresses these issues by providing:

- **Unified workspace** - Register any number of layouts; users open them as
  tabs in a single interface.
- **User-driven design** - Drag tabs to split panels, resize areas, and
  rearrange freely. Developers define content; users define structure.
- **Persistence** - Workspace state saves to localStorage, sessionStorage, or
  memory so users return to exactly where they left off.
- **Minimal boilerplate** - A decorator-based API keeps layout registration
  concise and readable.

## Features

- **User-Driven Layout** - Users style tabs with colors and icons, reorder them
  freely, and drag to panel edges to split the view. You create the content;
  they make the dashboard.
- **Favorites & Search** - Find layouts instantly with the integrated search
  bar. Mark frequently-used ones as favorites to pin them at the top.
- **On-Demand Loading** - Tab content loads dynamically when selected, keeping
  initial page load fast even with many registered layouts.
- **Parameterized Layouts** - Capture user options before loading a layout,
  minimizing server round-trips and delivering exactly what the user wants.
- **Custom Actions** - Add status bar buttons that trigger Dash callbacks for
  saving workspaces, exporting data, or any custom functionality.
- **Persistence & Workspace State** - State saves to localStorage, sessionStorage,
  or memory. Use `readWorkspace` and `updateWorkspace` for programmatic backup,
  restore, or team sharing.
- **Context Menus** - Right-click tabs to rename, duplicate, lock, style, or
  generate a shareable link to send a specific tab to someone else.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Full keyboard navigation: new tab, close, rename,
  undo close, switch tabs, and more.
- **Error Resilience** - Errors are captured at the tab level, guarding against
  crashes that would otherwise take down the workspace.

## Light and Dark Mode

Dash Prism supports both light and dark themes, so the workspace adapts to your style.

@dash_prism.register_layout(id='home', name='Home')
def home():
    return html.Div('Welcome to Dash Prism')

@dash_prism.register_layout(id='analytics', name='Analytics')
def analytics():
    return html.Div('Analytics content here')

app.layout = html.Div([
    dash_prism.Prism(id='workspace', persistence=True)
])

dash_prism.init('workspace', app)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
