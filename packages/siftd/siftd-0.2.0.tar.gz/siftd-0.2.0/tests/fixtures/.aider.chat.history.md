#### fix the bug in auth.py

Looking at auth.py, I can see the token refresh is failing silently. Here's the fix:

```python
def refresh_token(self):
    try:
        response = self.client.refresh(self.token)
        self.token = response.token
    except RefreshError as e:
        raise AuthError(f"Token refresh failed: {e}")
```
