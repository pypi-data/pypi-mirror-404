#     SWR_PARSER_00101: YAML Configuration for Enumeration Literal Word Mapping

# Enumeration literal configuration
enumeration_literals:
  # Continuation words indicate that a line should be appended to the previous
  # literal's description. These words commonly appear at the start of lines
  # that are continuations of descriptions split across multiple lines.
  # Use quoted strings to prevent YAML boolean/type interpretation
  continuation_words:
    - "enable"
    - "qualification"
    - "the"
    - "condition"
    - "conditions"
    - "of"
    - "or"
    - "and"
    - "with"
    - "will"
    - "after"
    - "related"
    - "all"
    - "first"
    - "last"
    - "on"
    - "in"
    - "out"
    - "up"
    - "down"

  # Suffix words indicate that a line should be appended to the previous
  # literal's name. These words typically complete literal names that are
  # split across multiple lines (e.g., "On" + "First" = "OnFirst").
  # Use quoted strings to prevent YAML boolean/type interpretation
  suffix_words:
    - "first"
    - "last"
    - "on"
    - "in"
    - "out"
    - "up"
    - "down"

  # Header exclusion patterns identify header text that should not be treated
  # as enumeration literals. These patterns appear in PDF headers around
  # enumeration tables and should be filtered out during parsing.
  header_exclusion_patterns:
    - "extract template"
    - "cp r23-11"
    - "r23-11"
    - "template"
    - "autosar"
    - "diagnostic"

  # Header words are individual words that, when combined with header exclusion
  # patterns in the description, indicate the line is header text rather than
  # a valid enumeration literal.
  header_words:
    - "Diagnostic"
    - "AUTOSAR"
    - "Generic"
    - "Structure"
    - "Timing"

  # Manual patches for enumeration literals that don't merge correctly
  # even after improved multiline logic. Use sparingly - only for edge cases.
  # Format: enumeration_name: { wrong_name: correct_name } (applies to all occurrences)
  #        or { wrong_name: {correct_name: target_index} } (applies only to specific index)
  patches:
    DiagnosticEventCombinationReportingBehaviorEnum:
      reportingInChronlogicalOrder: reportingInChronlogicalOrderOldestFirst
    ByteOrderEnum:
      mostSignificantByte:
        mostSignificantByteFirst: 0
        mostSignificantByteLast: 1
