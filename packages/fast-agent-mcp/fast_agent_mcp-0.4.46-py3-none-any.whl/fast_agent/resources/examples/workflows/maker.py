MAKER: Massively decomposed Agentic processes with K-voting Error Reduction.

This example demonstrates the MAKER workflow pattern for achieving high
reliability through statistical consensus voting.

Based on the paper:
    "Solving a Million-Step LLM Task with Zero Errors"
    Meyerson et al., 2024
    https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09030

Key Concepts:
-------------
1. **First-to-ahead-by-k Voting**: Multiple samples are drawn from a worker
   agent. The first response to achieve a k-vote margin over all alternatives
   wins. This provides provable error bounds.

2. **Red-Flagging**: Responses that show signs of confusion (too long,
   malformed) are discarded before voting, improving effective success rate.

3. **Cost-Effective Reliability**: By trading compute (multiple samples) for
   accuracy (statistical consensus), cheap models can achieve high reliability.

When to Use MAKER:
------------------
MAKER is designed for **long chains of simple steps** where errors compound:

Good use cases:
- **ETL pipelines**: 1000s of row transformations - one bad parse = corrupted data
- **Code migration**: 1000s of file changes - one syntax error = build fails
- **Document processing**: 1000s of pages - one missed field = compliance failure
- **Data validation**: Millions of records - one wrong validation = bad data in prod
- **Automated testing**: 1000s of assertions - one false positive = wasted debugging
- **Cost optimization**: Cheap model + voting can replace expensive model

When NOT to use MAKER:
- Single classifications (just use a good model - 95% accuracy is fine)
- Creative/open-ended tasks (no "correct" answer to vote on)
- Complex reasoning (need smarter model, not more samples)
- Tasks where occasional errors are acceptable

The Math:
---------
- 95% per-step accuracy over 100 steps = 0.6% overall success (0.95^100)
- 99.9% per-step accuracy (with MAKER) over 100 steps = 90% overall success
- For million-step tasks, even 99% per-step fails; MAKER enables 99.99%+

Demo Use Case:
--------------
This example shows customer message intent classification. While modern LLMs
are quite consistent on this task (you'll see 3:0 votes), the mechanism
demonstrates how voting works. In production with harder tasks or longer
chains, MAKER's value becomes critical.

Usage:
------
    uv run examples/workflows/maker.py

Try modifying k (voting margin) and observe how it affects reliability vs cost.
