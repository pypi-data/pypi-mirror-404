"""Agents-as-Tools example: project managers for NY and London.

Children are exposed as tools: agent__NY-Project-Manager, agent__London-Project-Manager.

Parent agent ("PMO-orchestrator") calls two child agents
("NY-Project-Manager" and "London-Project-Manager") as tools. 

Each child uses the `time` MCP server for local time and the `fetch` MCP server for a short
news-based update on the given topics.

Common usage patterns may combine:

- Routing: choose the right specialist tool(s) based on the user prompt.
- Parallelization: fan out over independent items/projects, then aggregate.
- Orchestrator-workers: break a task into scoped subtasks (often via a simple JSON plan), then coordinate execution.

How it works:

- You declare a parent agent with `agents=[...]`.
- At runtime it is instantiated as an internal `AgentsAsToolsAgent`, which:
  - Inherits from `McpAgent` (keeps its own MCP servers/tools).
  - Exposes each child agent as a tool (`agent__ChildName`).
  - Merges MCP tools and agent-tools in a single `list_tools()` surface.
  - Supports history/parallel controls:
    - `history_source` (where child clones load history from):
      - `none` (default): clones start with empty history
      - `child`: clones start from the template child history
      - `orchestrator`: clones start from the parent/orchestrator history
    - `history_merge_target` (where clone history is merged back to):
      - `none` (default): no merge-back
      - `child`: merge into the template child history
      - `orchestrator`: merge into the parent/orchestrator history
    - `max_parallel` (default unlimited)
    - `child_timeout_sec` (default none)
    - `max_display_instances` (default 20; collapse progress after top-N)
