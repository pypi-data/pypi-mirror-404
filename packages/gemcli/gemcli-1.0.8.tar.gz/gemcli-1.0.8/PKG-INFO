[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/gemcli.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/gemcli/)

A professional Python command-line interface that leverages Google's consumer Gemini AI for unlimited code completions, autonomous file operations, system automation, and AI image generation - all directly from your terminal.

GemCLI provides a high-fidelity terminal experience with real-time markdown rendering, customizable themes, and browser-based authentication.

---

**NEW FEATURE: AutoBot Mode** 
GemCLI now includes **AutoBot**, a fully autonomous agent system capable of planning and executing multi-step tasks. AutoBot can navigate your filesystem, create complex project structures, and manage dependencies without constant manual intervention.

---

**PRIVACY & SECURITY** 
This is a CLIENT-SIDE application with NO SERVER component. Your data remains on YOUR machine. All processing is local. Session tokens never leave your system.

---

## Key Features

* **AutoBot Autonomous System**: Advanced multi-step task execution and project bootstrapping.
* **Modern Terminal Interface**: Built with Rich library for beautiful, responsive command-line experience
* **Four Operating Modes**: Chat, System Agent (AI Coding Assistant), AutoBot (Autonomous), and Image Generation
* **Browser Cookie Authentication**: Automatic session extraction from Chrome, Edge, or Firefox - no API key needed
* **File Operations**: Read, edit, search, and create files through AI commands in Agent modes
* **System Command Execution**: Control system operations - open applications, adjust brightness/volume, launch file explorer, manage media playback
* **Git Integration**: Automatic commit, push, and AI-generated commit messages for version control
* **Diff Viewer**: Preview code changes before applying with VS Code or terminal-based diff view
* **Six Theme Profiles**: Customize with Cyan, Pink, Gold, Green, Purple, or White color schemes
* **Asynchronous Architecture**: Non-blocking API communication built on asyncio
* **Complete Privacy**: Client-side only - your session tokens never leave your local machine

## Modes & Capabilities

GemCLI offers four distinct operating modes, each tailored for specific use cases:

| Mode | Ask/Response | Read Files | Edit Files | Workspace Search | Autonomous | System Cmds |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Chat** | Yes | No | No | No | No | No |
| **System Agent** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **AutoBot** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Image Gen** | Yes | No | No | No | No | No |

### Mode Descriptions

#### AutoBot Mode (Autonomous Agent)
Our flagship autonomous coding assistant. AutoBot can:
- Search your entire workspace for relevant files
- Read any files it determines necessary
- Make coordinated changes across multiple files
- Work independently to solve complex, multi-step prompts
- Execute system commands and manage project lifecycles

#### Chat Mode
Basic conversational AI interface. Ask questions, receive answers, and engage in natural conversations with Gemini.

#### System Agent Mode (AI Coding Assistant)
Enhanced mode where you specify files to work with. Gemini can suggest code modifications and apply changes with your approval.

#### Image Generation Mode
Create AI-generated images from text descriptions with customizable save locations.

## Installation

### Option 1: Install from PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
pip install gemcli
```

### Option 2: Install from GitHub

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Aniketh78/Gemini-Terminal-Tool-GEM-CLI.git
```

### Option 3: Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aniketh78/Gemini-Terminal-Tool-GEM-CLI.git
cd Gemini-Terminal-Tool-GEM-CLI
pip install .
```

### Option 4: Development Mode

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aniketh78/Gemini-Terminal-Tool-GEM-CLI.git
cd Gemini-Terminal-Tool-GEM-CLI
pip install -e .
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git (optional, for git integration features)
- VS Code (optional, for diff previews)

---

## Quick Start

After installation, run GemCLI using:

```bash
gemcli
```

---

## Authentication Setup (Cookie-Based)

GemCLI uses browser cookie authentication to connect to Google Gemini. **No API key required!**

### Step-by-Step Cookie Setup

1. **Open Google Gemini** - Visit [gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com) in your browser
2. **Log in** to your Google account
3. **Open Developer Tools** - Press `F12` (or right-click > "Inspect")
4. **Navigate to Cookies**:
   - Go to the **Application** tab (Chrome/Edge) or **Storage** tab (Firefox)
   - Expand **Cookies** in the sidebar
   - Click on `https://gemini.google.com`
5. **Find and copy these cookies**:
   - `__Secure-1PSID` (required)
   - `__Secure-1PSIDTS` (optional, but recommended)
6. **Paste into GemCLI** when prompted on first run

### Is This Safe?

**Yes, absolutely!** Here's why:

| Concern | Answer |
|:--------|:-------|
| **Where are cookies stored?** | Locally in `.gemini_cookies.json` in your working directory |
| **Do cookies leave my machine?** | **NO** - They are only sent directly to Google's Gemini servers |
| **Is there a server component?** | **NO** - This is 100% client-side |
| **Can anyone see my cookies?** | Only you - the file stays on your local machine |
| **Should I share my cookies?** | **NEVER** share your cookies with anyone |

> **Important**: Treat your cookies like passwords. Never commit `.gemini_cookies.json` to version control (it's already in `.gitignore`).

---

## Running GemCLI

### First Run

1. Run `gemcli` in your terminal
2. When prompted, paste your cookie values (see Authentication Setup above)
3. Select your desired mode from the menu
4. Start chatting!

### Subsequent Runs

GemCLI remembers your cookies, so just run:

```bash
gemcli
```

And you'll be asked if you want to use saved cookies or enter new ones.

### Example Workflows

**Ask AI to modify code:**
```
You: /gemini_cli.py add a new feature to handle user authentication
```
*AI reads the file, suggests changes, opens diff preview, you accept/reject*

**Git with AI commit messages:**
```
You: /commit
```
*AI analyzes your changes and generates a smart commit message*

**Generate images:**
```
You: Create a beautiful sunset over mountains with vibrant colors
```
*AI generates and saves the image to your configured directory*
