"""AppKit Image Creator package.

Provides image generation functionality with multiple AI backends
and a modern gallery UI.

Note: Components must be imported directly from their modules after
app configuration is complete to avoid circular imports:

    from appkit_imagecreator.pages import image_generator_page
    from appkit_imagecreator.page import image_gallery_page
    from appkit_imagecreator.state import ImageGalleryState
