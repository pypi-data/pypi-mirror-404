## 🎯 What is ShadowKill?

ShadowKill is a discreet desktop guardian that listens for a **double-knock** on your desk and instantly:
- ✅ Closes ALL browser tabs (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, Opera)
- ✅ Kills browser processes completely
- ✅ Opens a professional Excel spreadsheet (`Work_Report_2024.xlsx`)

Perfect for maintaining professional appearances when unexpected visitors arrive! 😎

---

## 📥 Download & Installation

### Option 1: Download Executable (Recommended)
1. Download `ShadowKill.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/rushanhaque/Shadow-chat/releases) page
2. Place it in any folder on your computer
3. Double-click to run - **no installation required!**

### Option 2: Run from Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rushanhaque/Shadow-chat.git
cd ShadowKill

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the script
python shadow_kill.py
```

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Launch ShadowKill.exe** (or run `python shadow_kill.py`)
2. **Grant microphone access** when prompted
3. **Double-knock your desk** quickly (within 1 second between knocks)
4. **Watch the magic happen!** 🎩✨

### Controls
- **Ctrl+C** - Stop the application
- **Double Knock** - Trigger panic mode

### Console Output
```
========================================
           SHADOW KILL          
========================================
Threshold: 0.5
Target file: Work_Report_2024.xlsx
Listening for a QUICK DOUBLE KNOCK on the desk...
----------------------------------------
Press Ctrl+C to stop.
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit `shadow_kill.py` to customize behavior:

```python
THRESHOLD = 0.5      # Volume threshold (increase if too sensitive)
COOLDOWN = 1.5       # Cooldown after activation (seconds)
KNOCK_WINDOW = 1.0   # Max time between two knocks (seconds)
BROWSERS = ["chrome.exe", "msedge.exe", "firefox.exe", "brave.exe", "opera.exe"]
OFFICE_FILE = "Work_Report_2024.xlsx"  # File to open
```

### Adjusting Sensitivity
If the app is **too sensitive** (triggering from background noise):
- Increase `THRESHOLD` to `0.7` or higher

If it's **not sensitive enough**:
- Decrease `THRESHOLD` to `0.3` or lower
- Knock harder on your desk

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security

- **100% Local** - No data leaves your computer
- **No Internet Required** - Works completely offline
- **Open Source** - Inspect the code yourself
- **Microphone Only** - Only listens for knock patterns

### Antivirus False Positives
Some antivirus software may flag the `.exe` as suspicious (common with PyInstaller apps). This is a **false positive** because:
- The app monitors system processes
- It kills processes (browsers)
- It's packaged as a single executable

**Solutions:**
1. Add `ShadowKill.exe` to your antivirus exclusions
2. Run from source code instead
3. Build the executable yourself using `pyinstaller ShadowKill.spec`

## 📋 System Requirements

- **OS**: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- **Microphone**: Any working microphone
- **RAM**: 100MB minimum
- **Storage**: 25MB for executable

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Could not start audio stream"
**Solution:** Check microphone permissions in Windows Settings
1. Settings → Privacy → Microphone
2. Enable microphone access for desktop apps

### Excel file doesn't open
**Solution:** Ensure `Work_Report_2024.xlsx` is in the same folder as the executable

### Browsers don't close
**Solution:** Run as Administrator (right-click → Run as administrator)

### App triggers too easily
**Solution:** Increase `THRESHOLD` in configuration

## 🏗️ Building from Source

Want to build your own executable?

```bash
# Install PyInstaller
pip install pyinstaller

# Build the executable
pyinstaller --clean ShadowKill.spec

# Find your .exe in the dist/ folder
```
