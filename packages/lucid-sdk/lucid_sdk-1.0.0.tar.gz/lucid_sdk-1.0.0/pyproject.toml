# Optional dependencies are intentionally empty.
# The SDK provides a framework for building auditors, but does not directly import
# specialized safety libraries. Auditors that need specific libraries (e.g., presidio,
# llm-guard, detoxify) should add them as direct dependencies in their own pyproject.toml.
#
# See README.md for documentation on the "dependency injection" pattern for auditors.
#
# Note: ZK functionality requires snarkjs which must be installed separately (not on PyPI).
# The SDK will check for snarkjs availability at runtime.
