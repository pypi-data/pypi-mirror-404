# BROKENXAPI

**BROKENXAPI** is a high-performance asynchronous **Python SDK and CLI** that enables developers to search and download YouTube audio or video through a remote backend API.

It is built for **automation tools**, **Telegram bots**, and **production systems** where reliability, speed, and a clean developer experience are critical.

The SDK abstracts authentication and networking, while the CLI provides a fast and simple way to interact with the API directly from the terminal.

from brokenxapi import BrokenXAPI

async def main():
    async with BrokenXAPI(api_key="BROKENXAPI-XXXX") as api:
        # Search YouTube
        search = await api.search("moosetape", video=False)
        video_id = search["video_id"]

        # Download audio
        audio = await api.download(video_id, "audio")
        print(audio["telegram_url"])

asyncio.run(main())
```

---

```python
async with BrokenXAPI(api_key="BROKENXAPI-XXXX") as api:
    video = await api.download("VIDEO_ID", "video")
    print(video["telegram_url"])
