# blend-x-glb

Handy CLI to convert a bunch of blends to GLBs.

## Using the tool

Convert blend files into GLB using blender by calling the tool like this:

```bash
blend-x-glb ./your_blend_dir ./GLBs
```

It's that easy! Or if you prefer an interactive mode `blend-x-glb --ask`

This tries to use your system's blender: if blender is not installed converting
won't work.
