## About

### Features

- **Blueprint Library**: View, filter, and search all your EVE Online blueprints by character, corporation, type, and efficiency.
- **Industry Job Tracking**: Monitor and filter your manufacturing, research, and invention jobs in real time.
- **Blueprint Copy Sharing**: Request, offer, and deliver blueprint copies (BPCs) with collapsible fulfillment cards, inline access list summaries, signed Discord quick-action links, and notifications for each step.
- **Flexible Sharing Scopes**: Expose blueprint libraries per character, per corporation, or to everyone at once.
- **Conditional Offer Chat**: Negotiate blueprint copy terms directly in Indy Hub with persistent history and status tracking.
- **Material Exchange**: Create buy/sell orders with order references, validate ESI contracts, and review transaction history.
- **Material Exchange UX**: Compact order detail headers with quick-copy helpers (order reference, buyer/corporation, EVE-friendly totals).
- **ESI Integration**: Secure OAuth2-based sync for blueprints and jobs with director-level corporation scopes.
- **Notifications**: In-app alerts for job completions, copy offers, chat messages, and deliveries, with configurable immediate or digest cadences.

  - View and manage personal blueprints
  - Create and manage blueprint copy requests
  - Use Material Exchange (buy/sell orders)
  - View personal industry jobs
  - Configure personal settings and notifications

### Corporation Management (Optional)

- **`indy_hub.can_manage_corp_bp_requests`** → "Can manage corporation indy"
  - View and manage corporation blueprints (director only)
  - Handle corporation blueprint copy requests (accept/reject corp BP copy sharing)
  - Access corporation industry jobs
  - Configure corporation sharing settings
  - This role is **not** meant for everyone — only for people who manage corp BPs (they can handle contracts for corpmates)
  - Requires ESI director roles for the corporation

### Material Exchange Administration (Optional)

- **`indy_hub.can_manage_material_hub`** → "Can manage Mat Exchange"
