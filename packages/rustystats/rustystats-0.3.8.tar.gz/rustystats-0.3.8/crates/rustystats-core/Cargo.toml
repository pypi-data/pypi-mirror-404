# =============================================================================
# RustyStats Core - Pure Rust Statistics Library
# =============================================================================
# This crate contains all the mathematical and statistical logic for GLMs.
# It has NO Python dependencies - it's pure Rust, which means:
#   - It can be tested independently with `cargo test`
#   - It can be used in other Rust projects
#   - The logic is separate from the Python "glue code"
#
# MAINTAINER NOTES:
# -----------------
# When adding new features, add them here first, test them thoroughly,
# then expose them to Python via the `rustystats` crate.

[dependencies]
# N-dimensional arrays - think of it like NumPy for Rust
# We use this for all matrix and vector operations
ndarray = { workspace = true }

# Pure Rust linear algebra - used for IRLS solver
# No system dependencies needed (unlike ndarray-linalg which needs BLAS)
nalgebra = { workspace = true }

# Nice error handling - makes error messages clear and helpful
thiserror = { workspace = true }

# Statistical distributions (Normal, Gamma, etc.) and functions
statrs = { workspace = true }

# Parallel computation - for multi-threaded IRLS
rayon = { workspace = true }

[dev-dependencies]
# For comparing floating-point numbers in tests (handles rounding errors)
approx = { workspace = true }
