# =============================================================================
# RustyStats Python Bindings
# =============================================================================
# This crate is the "bridge" between Rust and Python.
# It wraps the pure Rust code from `rustystats-core` and exposes it to Python.
#
# This uses PyO3, which lets us:
#   - Call Rust functions from Python
#   - Convert between Python/NumPy types and Rust types
#   - Create Python classes backed by Rust structs
#
# BUILDING:
# ---------
# Use `maturin develop` to build and install locally for testing
# Use `maturin build --release` to create distribution wheels
# =============================================================================
