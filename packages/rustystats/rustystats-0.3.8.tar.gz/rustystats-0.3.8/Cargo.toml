# RustyStats - Rust Workspace Configuration
# =============================================================================
# This is the root configuration file for the Rust components of RustyStats.
# 
# The project is organized as a Cargo "workspace" with two main parts:
#   1. rustystats-core: Pure Rust library with all the math/statistics logic
#   2. rustystats:      Python bindings that expose the Rust code to Python
#
# This separation keeps the core logic clean and testable independently
# from the Python integration layer.
# =============================================================================

[workspace]
members = ["crates/rustystats"]
resolver = "2"

# =============================================================================
# Shared Dependencies
# =============================================================================
# Dependencies listed here can be inherited by workspace members using:
#   some-crate = { workspace = true }
# This ensures all crates use the same versions, avoiding conflicts.

# --- Linear Algebra ---
# ndarray: N-dimensional arrays, similar to NumPy for Python
# We use this for all matrix and vector operations
# The "approx" feature enables floating-point comparison support for tests
ndarray = { version = "0.16", features = ["approx"] }

# nalgebra: Pure Rust linear algebra library
# Used for matrix operations in the IRLS solver (no system dependencies needed!)
nalgebra = "0.33"

# --- Python Integration ---
pyo3 = { version = "0.22", features = ["extension-module"] }  # Rust <-> Python bridge
numpy = "0.22"                             # NumPy array support for PyO3

# --- Utilities ---
thiserror = "2.0"                          # Easy error type definitions
approx = "0.5"                             # Floating-point comparisons for tests
rayon = "1.10"                             # Data parallelism for multi-threaded computation

# --- Statistical Functions ---
# statrs provides probability distributions for p-value calculations
