"""
Spline basis functions for non-linear continuous effects in GLMs.

This module provides B-splines and natural splines for modeling non-linear
relationships between continuous predictors and the response variable.

Key Functions
-------------
- `bs()` - B-spline basis (flexible piecewise polynomials)
- `ns()` - Natural spline basis (linear extrapolation at boundaries)

Parameters
----------
Both `bs()` and `ns()` support two modes:

**Default (penalized smooth):** No parameters = auto-tuned via GCV
    >>> basis = rs.bs(x)  # Defaults to k=10, penalized smooth

**Fixed df mode:** Use `df` parameter for fixed degrees of freedom
    >>> basis = rs.bs(x, df=5)  # Exactly 5 df, no penalty

**Explicit penalized smooth:** Use `k` parameter 
    >>> basis = rs.bs(x, k=15)  # 15 basis functions, penalized

**Monotonicity (bs only):** Use `monotonicity` parameter for constrained effects
    >>> basis = rs.bs(x, df=5, monotonicity="increasing")

Example
-------
>>> import rustystats as rs
>>> import numpy as np
>>> 
>>> # Fixed df B-spline
>>> age = np.array([25, 35, 45, 55, 65])
>>> age_basis = rs.bs(age, df=5)
>>> print(age_basis.shape)
(5, 4)

>>> # Penalized smooth (auto-tuned via GCV during fitting)
>>> result = rs.glm("y ~ bs(age, k=10)", data=data, family="poisson").fit()

>>> # Monotonically increasing effect
>>> result = rs.glm("y ~ bs(age, df=5, monotonicity='increasing')", data=data).fit()

When to Use Each Type
---------------------
**B-splines (`bs`):**
- More flexible at boundaries
- Good when you don't need to extrapolate
- Standard choice for most applications
- Supports monotonicity constraints via I-spline basis

**Natural splines (`ns`):**
- Linear extrapolation beyond boundaries
- Better for prediction on new data outside training range
- More stable parameter estimates at boundaries
- Recommended for actuarial applications

Performance Note
----------------
Spline basis computation is implemented in Rust with parallel
evaluation over observations, making it very fast even for
large datasets.

    Compute B-spline basis matrix.
    
    B-splines (basis splines) are piecewise polynomial functions that provide
    a flexible way to model non-linear relationships. They are the foundation
    for many modern smoothing techniques.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array-like
        Data points to evaluate the basis at. Will be converted to 1D numpy array.
    df : int, optional
        Degrees of freedom (fixed). Use this for fixed-complexity splines.
    k : int, optional
        Maximum basis size for penalized smooth terms. When k is provided,
        the spline becomes a penalized smooth term with automatic smoothness
        selection via GCV during model fitting. Typical range: 5-20.
        **Default**: If neither df nor k is provided, defaults to k=10
        (penalized smooth with automatic tuning).
    degree : int, default=3
        Polynomial degree of the splines:
        - 0: Step functions (not smooth)
        - 1: Linear splines (continuous but not smooth)
        - 2: Quadratic splines (smooth first derivative)
        - 3: Cubic splines (smooth first and second derivatives, most common)
    knots : list, optional
        Interior knot positions. If not provided, knots are placed at
        quantiles of x based on the df/k parameter.
    boundary_knots : tuple, optional
        (min, max) defining the boundary of the spline basis.
        If not provided, uses the range of x.
    include_intercept : bool, default=False
        Whether to include the intercept (constant) basis function.
        Usually False when used in regression models that already have
        an intercept term.
    monotonicity : str, optional
        Constrain the spline to be monotonic. Options:
        - "increasing": Effect must increase with x
        - "decreasing": Effect must decrease with x
        - None (default): No monotonicity constraint
        Uses I-spline (integrated M-spline) basis internally.
    
    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        Basis matrix of shape (n, basis_size) where n is the length of x.
    
    Notes
    -----
    **Fixed df vs penalized smooth (k):**
    
    - Use `df` when you know the exact flexibility needed
    - Use `k` when you want automatic smoothness selection via GCV
    
    **Monotonicity:**
    
    When monotonicity is specified, I-splines are used. Each basis function
    increases from 0 to 1, and with non-negative coefficients (enforced during
    fitting), the resulting curve is monotonic.
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> import rustystats as rs
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> 
    >>> # Fixed df B-spline
    >>> x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
    >>> basis = rs.bs(x, df=5)
    >>> print(basis.shape)
    (100, 4)
    
    >>> # Penalized smooth (auto-smoothing via GCV)
    >>> basis = rs.bs(x, k=10)  # Will be penalized during fitting

    Natural splines are cubic splines with the additional constraint that
    the function is linear beyond the boundary knots. This constraint:
    - Reduces the effective degrees of freedom by 2
    - Provides more sensible extrapolation behavior
    - Often gives more stable parameter estimates

    Notes
    -----
    **Fixed df vs penalized smooth (k):**
    
    - Use `df` when you know the exact flexibility needed
    - Use `k` when you want automatic smoothness selection via GCV
    
    Natural splines impose the constraint that the second derivative
    is zero at the boundaries. This means:
    
    1. The spline is linear (not curved) outside the boundary knots
    2. Extrapolation beyond the data range is more sensible
    3. The fit is often more stable near the boundaries
    
    For these reasons, natural splines are often preferred for:
    - Prediction on new data that may be outside the training range
    - Actuarial applications where extrapolation is common
    - When boundary behavior needs to be controlled
