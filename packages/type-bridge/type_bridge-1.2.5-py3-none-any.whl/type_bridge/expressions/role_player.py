"""Role-player expression for type-safe relation filtering.

This module provides a type-safe wrapper for filtering role players
by their attributes in relation queries.

TypeDB 3.x Variable Scoping:
    TypeDB uses variable bindings to create implicit equality constraints.
    If the same variable is used twice in a match clause, both bindings
    must have the same value.

    Wrong approach:
        $actor has name $name;    -- $name binds to actor's name
        $target has name $name;   -- CONSTRAINT: target's name must EQUAL actor's name!

    Correct approach (unique variables):
        $actor has name $actor_name;    -- $actor_name binds to actor's name
        $target has name $target_name;  -- $target_name binds to target's name (independent)

    This is why expressions generate ${var_prefix}_${attr_name} patterns.
