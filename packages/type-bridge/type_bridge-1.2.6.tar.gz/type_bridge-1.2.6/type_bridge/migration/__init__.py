"""TypeBridge Migration System.

A Django-style migration framework for TypeDB schemas with state tracking,
rollback support, and CLI tools.

Example - Migration file (migrations/0001_initial.py):
    from typing import ClassVar
    from type_bridge.migration import Migration
    from type_bridge.models import Entity, Relation
    from myapp.models import Person, Company, Employment

    class InitialMigration(Migration):
        dependencies: ClassVar[list[tuple[str, str]]] = []
        models: ClassVar[list[type[Entity | Relation]]] = [Person, Company, Employment]

Example - Operations-based migration (migrations/0002_add_phone.py):
    from typing import ClassVar
    from type_bridge.migration import Migration, operations as ops
    from type_bridge.migration.operations import Operation
    from myapp.models import Person, Phone

    class AddPhoneMigration(Migration):
        dependencies: ClassVar[list[tuple[str, str]]] = [("migrations", "0001_initial")]
        operations: ClassVar[list[Operation]] = [
            ops.AddAttribute(Phone),
            ops.AddOwnership(Person, Phone, optional=True),
        ]

Example - Programmatic API:
    from pathlib import Path
    from type_bridge.migration import MigrationExecutor
    from type_bridge.session import Database

    db = Database(address="localhost:1729", database="mydb")
    db.connect()

    executor = MigrationExecutor(db, Path("migrations"))

    # Apply all pending migrations
    executor.migrate()

    # Migrate to specific version
    executor.migrate(target="0002_add_phone")

    # Show migration status
    for name, is_applied in executor.showmigrations():
        print(f"[{'X' if is_applied else ' '}] {name}")

    # Preview TypeQL
    print(executor.sqlmigrate("0002_add_phone"))

CLI Usage:
    # Apply all pending migrations
    python -m type_bridge.migration migrate

    # Migrate to specific version
    python -m type_bridge.migration migrate 0002_add_phone

    # Show migration status
    python -m type_bridge.migration showmigrations

    # Preview TypeQL
    python -m type_bridge.migration sqlmigrate 0002_add_phone

    # Generate migration from model changes
    python -m type_bridge.migration makemigrations --name add_phone --models myapp.models
