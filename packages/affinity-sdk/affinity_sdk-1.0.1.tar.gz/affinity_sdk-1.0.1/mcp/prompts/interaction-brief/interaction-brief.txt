You need a quick interaction history brief for ${entityName}.

Using the CLI Gateway (discover-commands → execute-read-command):

1. **Find the entity** - Use `person ls --query "${entityName}"` or `company ls` to get their ID
2. **Get interactions** - Use `interaction ls --person-id <id> --type all` (or specific types: email, meeting, call, chat-message)
3. **Summarize** the interaction history:
   - Total interactions by type (calls, meetings, emails)
   - Most recent interaction date and type
   - Who from your team has been in contact
   - Frequency of communication

Provide a concise summary suitable for quick reference before a meeting or call.
