You need to find a warm introduction path to ${targetName}.

Using the CLI Gateway (discover-commands → execute-read-command):

1. **Find the target** - Use `person ls --query "${targetName}"` or `company ls` to locate them
2. **Get relationship data** - Use `relationship-strength ls --external-id <id>` to analyze:
   - Current relationship strength with ${targetName}
   - Who in your org has the strongest connection
3. **Analyze connections** - Use `interaction ls --person-id <id> --type all` to see:
   - Recent activity showing who on your team has interacted with them
   - Shared connections via interaction participants
4. **Provide recommendations**:
   - Best path for a warm intro (strongest connector)
   - Talking points based on shared context
   - Draft introduction request

Context for the introduction: ${context}
