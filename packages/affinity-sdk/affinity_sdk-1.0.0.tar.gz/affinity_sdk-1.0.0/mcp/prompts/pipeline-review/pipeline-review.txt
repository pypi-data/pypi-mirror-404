You are conducting a pipeline review for the "${listName}" list.

Using the CLI Gateway (discover-commands → execute-read-command):

1. **Get pipeline structure** - Use `field ls --list-id "${listName}"` to understand fields and status options
2. **Export pipeline items** - Use `list export "${listName}"` to get all entries
3. **Analyze each item** - Identify:
   - Time in current stage
   - Recent activity (last interaction/note)
   - Any stale deals that need attention
   - Next actions needed

Provide a summary organized by pipeline stage, highlighting:
- **Healthy deals** - Active and progressing
- **At risk** - Stale or lacking activity
- **Quick wins** - Close to conversion
- **Recommendations** - Suggested next steps for each at-risk item
