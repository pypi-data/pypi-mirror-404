# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-31

**First stable release.** The SDK and CLI APIs are now considered stable. Breaking changes will follow semantic versioning (major version bumps).

### Added
- CLI: Auto-update notifications. The CLI now checks PyPI daily (in background) and displays a notification when a new version is available. Notifications are suppressed in non-interactive environments (`--quiet`, `--output json`, CI, no TTY). Disable with `XAFFINITY_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` or `update_check = false` in config.
- CLI: `xaffinity config update-check --background` flag for non-blocking update checks. Used by MCP server to trigger background updates without waiting for results.

### Fixed
- MCP: Add `AFFINITY_API_KEY` to environment variable allowlist. API keys configured in Claude Desktop's MCP settings were being silently dropped, requiring manual config file creation as a workaround.
- MCP: Detect CLI in macOS Python framework path (`/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/*/bin/`). Users who installed via `pip install` with python.org Python were getting "xaffinity: command not found" errors.

## [0.16.1] - 2026-01-27

### Added
- Docs: "Verify Installation" section in CLI documentation with step-by-step health check instructions (`xaffinity --version`, `AFFINITY_API_KEY=... xaffinity whoami`).

## [0.16.0] - 2026-01-26

### Changed (Breaking)
- SDK: `Person.interactions` and `Company.interactions` attribute type changed from `dict[str, Any]` to typed `Interactions` model. Migration: change dict access (`person.interactions["last_event"]["person_ids"]`) to attribute access (`person.interactions.last_event.person_ids`). The `Interactions` model provides typed access to `first_email`, `last_email`, `first_event`, `last_event`, `next_event`, `last_chat_message`, and `last_interaction` fields, each containing an `InteractionEvent` with `date` and `person_ids` attributes.

### Fixed
- SDK: `PersonService.get()` field values are now properly validated as `FieldValue` models.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-01-25

### Fixed
- CLI: `query --output json` now supports cursor-based pagination when output is truncated. Previously, JSON truncation happened at the MCP layer after CLI execution, so no cursor was emitted. Now JSON truncation happens in the CLI layer (same as other formats), enabling proper resumption via `--cursor`.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-01-23

### Added
- CLI: `company files read`, `person files read`, `opportunity files read` commands to read file content with chunking support. Returns base64-encoded content with metadata (`size`, `offset`, `length`, `hasMore`, `nextOffset`). Use `--offset` and `--limit` to fetch large files in chunks. Default chunk size is 1MB.

### Fixed
- CLI: `--env-file` now implicitly enables dotenv loading when an explicit file path is provided (not the default `.env`). Previously, using `--env-file .sandbox.env` without `--dotenv` would silently ignore the file.
- CLI: Fixed dropdown field value resolution in `entry field --set` and `--append` commands. The V2 API requires `{"dropdownOptionId": ID}` format, but the CLI was sending raw values. Now dropdown text (e.g., "In Progress") or numeric IDs are properly resolved to the V2 API format.
- CLI: List field metadata now fetched from V1 API to include `dropdown_options`, which V2 API omits.

## 0.14.0 - 2026-01-22

### Added
- CLI: `company files ls`, `person files ls`, `opportunity files ls` commands to list files attached to entities without downloading them. Supports pagination (`--page-size`, `--cursor`, `--max-results`, `--all`), selector resolution (ID, URL, name, domain, email), and MCP safety limits.
- CLI: `file-url` command to get presigned download URLs for files. Returns URL valid for 60 seconds along with file metadata (name, size, contentType). Useful for programmatic access and MCP workflows.
- CLI: `files download --file-id` option for single-file downloads. Downloads one file directly without creating a manifest.
- SDK: `FilesService.get_download_url(file_id)` method to get presigned download URLs without downloading content. Returns `PresignedUrl` with URL, file metadata, and expiration info.
- SDK: `PresignedUrl` dataclass exported from `affinity` package with fields: `url`, `file_id`, `name`, `size`, `content_type`, `expires_in`, `expires_at`.

### Changed
- CLI: `files dump` renamed to `files download` for clarity.

### Fixed
- SDK: `CompanyService.get()` and `PersonService.get()` now automatically fall back to V1 API when V2 returns 404. This handles V1→V2 eventual consistency issues where a search (`company ls --query`, `person ls --query`) finds an entity via V1, but a subsequent `get` fails because V2 hasn't synced yet. The fallback is transparent and requires no code changes.

### Known Issues
- MCP: `get-file-url` tool returns valid presigned URLs, but Claude Desktop's WebFetch cannot access `userfiles.affinity.co` due to domain sandbox restrictions. This affects all Claude Desktop users - neither "Additional allowed domains" nor "All domains" settings work around this limitation ([#19087](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/19087), [#11897](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/11897)). Workaround: Use `files read` command (returns content inline), copy URL to browser, or use CLI directly with `files download --file-id`.

## 0.13.1 - 2026-01-21

### Fixed
- CLI: Query progress now emits `progress: 0` in `on_step_start` events, enabling mcp-bash timeout extension for slow first-page fetches

## 0.13.0 - 2026-01-21

### Changed (Breaking)
- SDK: `AffinityList.list_size` field removed. The V2 API returns incorrect values (often 0 for non-empty lists). Use `client.lists.get_size(list_id)` instead, which fetches from the V1 API and caches for 5 minutes.

### Added
- SDK: `ListService.get_size(list_id)` and `AsyncListService.get_size(list_id)` methods to get accurate list size from the V1 API with automatic caching (5 minutes). Use `force=True` to bypass cache when fresh data is critical.

## 0.12.0 - 2026-01-20

### Added
- CLI: `query --cursor` option for resumable pagination when responses are truncated (exceed `--max-output-bytes`):
  - **Streaming mode** (simple queries): O(1) resumption via stored Affinity API cursor - no re-fetching of previous pages
  - **Full-fetch mode** (queries with orderBy/aggregate): Results cached to disk, zero API calls on resume
  - Cursor emitted to stderr as NDJSON `{"type": "cursor", "cursor": "...", "mode": "..."}` for MCP extraction
  - CLI exits with code 100 when truncated (cursor available)
  - Cache auto-cleanup on startup: LRU eviction (500MB limit), 1-hour TTL
  - Validation: query hash, format mismatch, cache tampering all detected with clear errors

## 0.11.0 - 2026-01-20

### Added
- CLI: Full scan protection when running via MCP gateway. Commands with pagination (`list export`, `person ls`, `company ls`, etc.) now enforce limits: default 1000 records, max 10000 records. The `--all` flag is blocked with a clear error message guiding users to use explicit `--max-results` or cursor pagination instead.

### Changed
- CLI: `--csv` is now an alias for `--output csv` (consistent with `--json` being an alias for `--output json`)
- CLI: CSV sub-options (`--csv-bom`, `--csv-header`, `--csv-mode`) auto-enable CSV output when no format is specified
- CLI: Error messages for output flag conflicts no longer have trailing periods (e.g., `--csv and --json are mutually exclusive` instead of ending with `.`)

### Removed
- **Breaking**: CLI: `--pretty` flag removed from `query` command (use `| jq .` for pretty JSON output)

### Fixed
- CLI: Query engine now correctly computes `entityName` for Person list entries. Previously, `entityName` was `null` for persons because the API returns `firstName`/`lastName` instead of `name`. Now uses the same display name logic as `list export`.
- CLI: Table/CSV formatters now correctly detect Person entities with real API types (`external`/`internal`) or no type field. Previously, formatters only checked for `type="person"` which the API never actually returns, causing Person data to display as "object (N keys)" instead of "John Smith (id=123)".

### Performance
- CLI: Session cache now caches person resolution (by email/name) and company resolution (by domain/name), reducing API calls when running multiple commands in a session pipeline.
- CLI: Person and company field resolution now uses session cache, avoiding redundant field definition fetches.

## 0.10.0 - 2026-01-19

### Fixed
- SDK: Removed unsafe `asyncio.create_task()` in `AsyncAffinity.__del__` that could cause tasks to be garbage collected before completion. Users must now use context managers or call `close()` explicitly.
- SDK: Added thread-safe locking to `SimpleCache` for concurrent access.
- SDK: Fixed async client initialization race condition with asyncio lock.
- SDK: Fixed stream context manager cleanup on errors in HTTP client.
- SDK: Fixed empty/whitespace content handling in JSON response parsing.
- SDK: Added error handling for partial file cleanup on download failures.
- SDK: Improved filename sanitization for server-provided filenames (null bytes, control chars).
- CLI: Added validation for `--timeout`, `--max-columns`, `--max-records`, `--max-output-bytes` to reject non-positive values.
- CLI: Added validation for `--env-file` to check file exists when `--dotenv` is enabled.
- CLI: Added file size limit (1MB) for config files to prevent memory exhaustion.
- CLI: Added file permission warnings for API key files (same as config files).
- CLI: Fixed TOML escaping to handle newlines, tabs, and carriage returns in API keys.
- CLI: Fixed JSON/TOML parse error handling with helpful error messages.
- CLI: Fixed type validation for list access in CSV/table output (verify first element is dict).
- CLI: Fixed exponential backoff calculation to cap exponent before computing power.
- CLI: Let `AuthenticationError`/`AuthorizationError` propagate in query executor instead of silent catch.
- CLI: Added logging to silent exception handlers in entity validation.

### Changed (Breaking)
- CLI: `--check-unreplied-emails` renamed to `--check-unreplied` with support for both email and chat messages.
  - New `--unreplied-types` flag: comma-separated list of types to check (`email`, `chat`, `all`). Default: `email,chat`
  - Output now includes `type` field ("email" or "chat") in addition to date, daysSince, and subject
  - Chat messages have `null` subject (no subject attribute)
  - Cross-type reply detection: email replied via chat (or vice versa) counts as "replied"
- CLI: Query `expand: ["unrepliedEmails"]` renamed to `expand: ["unreplied"]`
  - Same cross-type reply detection and multi-type support as CLI flag
- CSV columns renamed: `unrepliedEmailDate` → `unrepliedDate`, `unrepliedEmailDaysSince` → `unrepliedDaysSince`, `unrepliedEmailSubject` → `unrepliedSubject`, plus new `unrepliedType` column

## 0.9.14 - 2026-01-19

### Fixed
- CLI: Query `select` clause now automatically includes `expand` fields. Previously, using `select` with `expand` would filter out the expansion data (e.g., `interactionDates`, `unreplied`), requiring users to explicitly list expansions in `select`.

## 0.9.13 - 2026-01-19

### Added
- CLI: Query `include` for `listEntries` now supports `persons`, `companies`, `opportunities`, and `interactions`. Fetches related entities based on list entry entity type (e.g., company entries get associated persons).
- CLI: Query `expand: ["unrepliedEmails"]` now works with `listEntries`. Checks each list entry's underlying entity for unreplied incoming emails.
- CLI: Query extended include syntax with parameters:
  - `{include: {interactions: {limit: 50, days: 180}}}` - Limit and lookback control
  - `{include: {opportunities: {list: "Pipeline"}}}` - Scope to specific opportunity list
  - `{include: {persons: {where: {...}}}}` - Filter included entities

### Fixed
- CLI: Query TOON format now correctly flattens `fields.*` and `interactionDates` like markdown and CSV formats do. Previously, TOON was missing the `_apply_explicit_flattening()` call, causing nested fields to be truncated and interaction dates to be missing entirely.
- CLI: `list export --check-unreplied-emails` now works standalone without requiring `--expand`.
- CLI: `expand: ["interactionDates"]` now always produces 8 canonical columns regardless of data presence, ensuring consistent schema across all records.
- SDK: Improved error message when adding wrong entity type to a list (e.g., adding a company to a person list). Now provides clear guidance about list type requirements instead of exposing raw API validation error.

### Performance
- CLI: Query `expand: ["interactionDates"]` is significantly faster with parallel person resolution, bounded concurrent fetches (semaphore=10), and parallelized section resolution. Default concurrency increased from 5 to 15 (tunable via `XAFFINITY_QUERY_CONCURRENCY`).

## 0.9.12 - 2026-01-17

### Changed
- CLI: Query `listEntries` now normalizes reference field values to display strings:
  - Person fields: `{"firstName": "Jane", "lastName": "Doe"}` → `"Jane Doe"`
  - Company fields: `{"name": "Acme Corp", "id": 123}` → `"Acme Corp"`
  - Multi-person/company fields: Arrays of names instead of raw objects
  - Use `expand` or `include` for full entity data when needed
- CLI: Query output with explicit `select` on `fields.*` paths now flattens fields to top-level columns in table/CSV/markdown formats. JSON output preserves nested structure.

## 0.9.11 - 2026-01-17

### Added
- CLI: Query `include` clause now displays included relationships inline by default. Use `--include-style=separate` for separate tables or `--include-style=ids-only` for raw IDs. JSON output includes full `included` and `included_by_parent` mappings for correlation.
- CLI: Query `include` extended syntax for custom display fields: `include: {companies: {display: ["name", "domain"]}}`.
- SDK: `with_interaction_dates` and `with_interaction_persons` parameters for `CompanyService.get()` and `PersonService.get()`. When enabled, routes to V1 API to fetch interaction date summaries (last/next meeting, email dates, team member IDs).
- CLI: `--expand interactions` option for `list export` command. Adds interaction date summaries to each list entry (last meeting, next meeting, last email, last interaction with daysSince/daysUntil calculations and team member names). Supports both JSON and CSV output formats.
- CLI: `expand: ["interactionDates"]` support in `query` command. Enriches records with interaction date summaries directly on each record in `result.data`. Works with `persons`, `companies`, and `listEntries` queries.
- CLI: `--check-unreplied-emails` flag for `list export` command. Detects unreplied incoming emails for each list entry and adds date, daysSince, and subject to output. Use `--unreplied-lookback-days` to configure lookback period (default: 30 days).
- CLI: `--with-interaction-dates` and `--with-interaction-persons` flags for `company get` and `person get` commands. Fetches interaction date summaries directly in entity get operations.
- MCP: Query tool `format` parameter now functional (was previously ignored). Supports `toon`, `markdown`, `json`, `jsonl`, `csv`.
- CLI: `--max-output-bytes` option for `query` command. Enables format-aware truncation for MCP use, returning exit code 100 when truncated.
- CLI: `format_toon_envelope()` function for TOON output with full envelope (`data[N]{...}:`, `pagination:`, `included_*:` sections).
- SDK: Batch association methods for PersonService, CompanyService, and OpportunityService:
  - `get_associated_company_ids_batch(person_ids)` / `get_associated_opportunity_ids_batch(person_ids)`
  - `get_associated_person_ids_batch(company_ids)` / `get_associated_opportunity_ids_batch(company_ids)`
  - `get_associated_person_ids_batch(opportunity_ids)` / `get_associated_company_ids_batch(opportunity_ids)`
  - All return `dict[EntityId, list[AssocId]]` with `on_error="raise"|"skip"` parameter.
- SDK: `retries` parameter on `persons.get()`, `companies.get()`, and `opportunities.get()` methods. Enables automatic retry with exponential backoff on 404 errors to handle V1→V2 eventual consistency after create operations. Default is `retries=0` (fail fast).
- CLI: Reminder date options now accept relative dates and keywords in addition to ISO-8601:
  - `--due-date`: `+7d`, `+2w`, `+1m`, `+1y`, `today`, `tomorrow`, `yesterday`, `now`
  - `--due-after`, `--due-before`: Same formats for filtering in `reminder ls`
  - Example: `xaffinity reminder create --due-date +7d --type one-time --owner-id 123`
- CLI: Domain validation for `company create` and `company update` now provides helpful error messages:
  - Detects underscores (RFC 1035 violation) and suggests dash replacement
  - Detects URL prefixes and extracts domain
  - Example: `--domain test_company.com` → "Use 'test-company.com' instead"
- Docs: V1→V2 eventual consistency guide covering 404 after create and stale data after update scenarios.
- Tests: Integration test suite for SDK write operations (`tests/integration/`).

### Changed
- SDK: `OpportunityService.get_associated_people()` and `get_associated_companies()` now use V2 batch lookup instead of individual V1 fetches, reducing N+1 API calls (e.g., 50 people now fetched in 2 calls instead of 51).
- SDK: Query executor `_batch_fetch_by_ids()` now uses V2 batch lookup for persons and companies, improving query performance on relationship includes.
- CLI: Query `include` clause now fetches relationship IDs in parallel, then batch-fetches full records via V2 API, reducing API calls from N×M to N+1 for deduped lookups.

### Changed (Breaking)
- MCP: Query tool default format changed from `json` to `toon` for better token efficiency (~40% fewer tokens).
- CLI: TOON query output now includes full envelope structure instead of data-only format. The `data` prefix is added to the array header: `data[N]{fields}:` instead of `[N]{fields}:`.

### Fixed
- MCP: Query tool now honors the `format` parameter instead of always using JSON output.
- SDK: `ListEntryService.batch_update_fields()` now uses correct V2 API payload format. Previously failed with "Missing discriminator for property operation" error.

## 0.9.9 - 2026-01-14

### Added
- CLI: `query` command now supports advanced relationship filtering:
  - `all` quantifier: Filter where all related items match a condition (e.g., find persons where all their companies have ".com" domains)
  - `none` quantifier: Filter where no related items match a condition (e.g., find persons with no spam interactions)
  - `exists` subquery: Filter where at least one related item exists, optionally matching a condition (e.g., find persons who have email interactions)
  - `_count` pseudo-field: Filter by count of related items (e.g., `"path": "companies._count", "op": "gte", "value": 2`)
  - Available relationship paths: persons→companies/opportunities/interactions/notes/listEntries, companies→persons/opportunities/interactions/notes/listEntries, opportunities→persons/companies/interactions
  - Note: These features cause N+1 API calls to fetch relationship data; use `--dry-run` to preview

### Changed (Breaking)
- CLI: Renamed relationship `"people"` to `"persons"` for consistency with entity type names:
  - Query `include`: `{"from": "companies", "include": ["people"]}` → use `["persons"]`
  - CLI `--expand`: `xaffinity company get <id> --expand people` → use `--expand persons`
  - JSON output: `data.people` → `data.persons`

### Fixed
- CLI: Query engine no longer silently passes all records for `all`, `none`, and `_count` filters. Previously these were placeholder implementations that returned `True` for all records, causing incorrect query results. (Bug #15)

## 0.9.8 - 2026-01-12

### Fixed
- CLI: `query` command now correctly fetches all records before applying filter, sort, or aggregate operations. Previously, limits were applied during fetch which caused incorrect results:
  - With filters: Empty results when matching records were beyond the limit position
  - With sort + limit: Random N records sorted instead of actual top N
  - With aggregate: Inaccurate counts/sums computed on partial data

## 0.9.7 - 2026-01-12

### Fixed
- CI: Smoke test now correctly installs CLI extras before testing CLI import

## 0.9.6 - 2026-01-12

### Added
- CLI: `listEntries` queries now include convenience aliases: `listEntryId`, `entityId`, `entityName`, `entityType`. These intuitive field names work in both `select` and `where` clauses.
- CLI: `listEntries` records now always include a `fields` key (defaults to `{}` if no custom fields).

### Changed
- CLI: Query projection now includes null values for explicitly selected fields. Previously, `select: ["entityName", "fields.Status"]` would return `{}` if Status was null; now returns `{"entityName": "Acme", "fields": {"Status": null}}`.

## 0.9.5 - 2026-01-12

### Added
- CLI: New `--output`/`-o` option supporting multiple formats: `json`, `jsonl`, `markdown`, `toon`, `csv`, `table` (default).
  - `markdown`: GitHub-flavored markdown tables, best for LLM analysis and comprehension
  - `toon`: Token-Optimized Object Notation, 30-60% fewer tokens than JSON for large datasets
  - `jsonl`: JSON Lines format, one object per line for streaming workflows
  - Example: `xaffinity person ls --output markdown`, `xaffinity query -o toon`
  - Existing `--csv` and `--json` flags continue to work as before.

### Changed
- CLI: `to_cell()` now extracts "text" from dropdown/multi-select fields instead of JSON-serializing the full dict. This makes CSV and other tabular outputs human-readable for dropdown values.

### Fixed
- CLI: `query` command with `limit` now correctly returns results when combined with client-side filters (like `has_any` on multi-select fields). Previously, the limit was applied during fetch before filtering, causing empty results when the first N records didn't match the filter criteria.

## 0.9.4 - 2026-01-12

### Added
- CLI: `query` command now supports `has_any` and `has_all` operators for multi-select field filtering.
- SDK/CLI: Filter parser now supports V2 API comparison operators: `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` for numeric/date comparisons.
- SDK/CLI: Filter parser now supports word-based operator aliases for LLM/human clarity:
  - `contains`, `starts_with`, `ends_with` (string matching)
  - `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte` (numeric/date comparisons)
  - `is null`, `is not null`, `is empty` (null/empty checks)
- SDK/CLI: Filter parser now supports collection bracket syntax `[A, B, C]` with operators:
  - `in [A, B]` - value is one of the listed values
  - `between [1, 10]` - value is in range (inclusive)
  - `has_any [A, B]` - array field contains any of the values
  - `has_all [A, B]` - array field contains all of the values
  - `contains_any [A, B]` - substring match for any term
  - `contains_all [A, B]` - substring match for all terms
  - `= [A, B]` - set equality (array has exactly these elements)
  - `=~ [A, B]` - V2 API collection contains (array contains all elements)

### Fixed
- CLI: `query` command now correctly filters on multi-select dropdown fields (like "Team Member"). The `eq` operator checks array membership for scalar values and set equality for array values. Previously, these queries returned 0 results due to strict equality comparison.
- SDK/CLI: `list export --filter` now correctly matches multi-select dropdown fields. The `=`, `!=`, and `=~` operators now handle array values properly. Also fixes extraction of text values from multi-select dropdown API responses.
- SDK/CLI: Fixed `=^` (starts_with) and `=$` (ends_with) operators which were broken due to tokenizer ordering issue.

### Improved
- SDK/CLI: Filter parser now provides helpful hints for common mistakes:
  - Multi-word field names: suggests quoting (`"Team Member"`)
  - Multi-word values: suggests quoting (`"Intro Meeting"`)
  - SQL keywords (`AND`, `OR`): suggests correct symbols (`&`, `|`)
  - Double equals (`==`): suggests single `=`

## 0.9.3 - 2026-01-11

### Changed
- CI: SDK releases now include MCPB bundle and plugin ZIP for convenience.
- CI: Enabled PyPI attestations via workflow_dispatch API trigger.

## 0.9.2 - 2026-01-11

### Fixed
- SDK: `AsyncListEntryService.pages()` now supports `progress_callback` parameter (sync/async parity fix).

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: CLI: `interaction ls` JSON output restructured for consistency:
  - `.data.interactions` → `.data` (direct array)
  - `.data.metadata.totalRows` → `.meta.summary.totalRows`
  - `.data.metadata.dateRange` → `.meta.summary.dateRange`
  - `.data.metadata.typeStats` → `.meta.summary.typeBreakdown`
- **BREAKING**: CLI: `note ls` JSON output restructured for consistency:
  - `.data.notes` → `.data` (direct array)
  - Pagination: `.data.notes.nextCursor` → `.meta.pagination.nextCursor`
- **BREAKING**: CLI: `query` JSON output (with `--include-meta`) restructured for consistency:
  - `.meta.recordCount` → `.meta.summary.totalRows`
  - Included entity counts now in `.meta.summary.includedCounts`
- CLI: Standardized `ResultSummary` footer rendering across all commands (displays row counts, date ranges, type breakdowns as compact footer text instead of tables).

## 0.9.1 - 2026-01-11

### Added
- CLI: `query` command now validates entity queryability and provides clear error messages for unsupported entities.
- CLI: `query` command resolves field names to IDs automatically (e.g., `"field": "Status"` works alongside `"fieldId": 123`).

### Fixed
- CLI: `query` for `listEntries` entity now correctly requires `listId` filter.
- CLI: `query` relationship definitions now correctly set `requires_n_plus_1` flag for proper query planning.

## 0.9.0 - 2026-01-11

### Added
- CLI: New `query` command for structured JSON queries with complex filtering, includes, aggregations, and sorting. Use `--dry-run` to preview execution plans. Supports entities: persons, companies, opportunities, listEntries, interactions, notes.
- MCP: New `query` tool for complex data queries via JSON query language. Supports filtering (AND/OR/NOT), includes (related entities), aggregations (count/sum/avg/min/max), groupBy, and sorting.
- CLI: `--limit` alias for `--max-results` on `company get`, `person get`, and `opportunity get` commands (consistency with `ls` commands).

### Changed
- CLI: `--list`, `--list-entry-field`, and `--show-list-entry-fields` now auto-imply `--expand list-entries` on `company get` and `person get` commands (improved DX).

## 0.8.6 - 2026-01-10

### Added
- SDK: `PersonService.get_associated_company_ids()` and `get_associated_opportunity_ids()` methods for symmetric association API.
- SDK: `CompanyService.get_associated_opportunity_ids()` method.

## 0.8.5 - 2026-01-10

### Fixed
- CLI/SDK: `FilterParseError` now raised when filter expressions fail to parse (previously silently ignored). Common cause: unquoted multi-word values like `--filter 'Status=Intro Meeting'` must be quoted: `--filter 'Status="Intro Meeting"'`.
- CLI: Pre-commit hook now validates installed CLI version matches `pyproject.toml` before regenerating MCP registry.

## 0.8.4 - 2026-01-10

### Added
- CLI: NDJSON progress output for `interaction ls` multi-type queries (MCP integration).

## 0.8.3 - 2026-01-10

### Added
- CLI: `--limit` alias for `--max-results` on all `ls` commands (LLM-friendly).
- CLI: Option aliases now included in `--help --json` output.

## 0.8.2 - 2026-01-10

_No user-facing changes. Version bump for PyPI release._

## 0.8.1 - 2026-01-10

_No user-facing changes. Version bump for PyPI release._

## 0.8.0 - 2026-01-10

### Changed
- CLI: Renamed `--json` to `--set-json` on `person field`, `company field`, `opportunity field` commands to avoid conflict with global `--json` output flag.
- **BREAKING**: CLI: `--csv FILE` is now `--csv` flag that outputs CSV to stdout. Use shell redirection: `--csv > file.csv`. Applies to `person ls`, `company ls`, `opportunity ls`, `list export`.
- CLI: `--csv` and `--json` are now mutually exclusive (error if both specified).
- CLI: `person ls --query` and `company ls --query` now support `--field` and `--field-type` options via hybrid V1→V2 fetch.
- **BREAKING**: CLI: `interaction ls` date filter parameters renamed for consistency:
  - `--start-time` → `--after`
  - `--end-time` → `--before`
  - Context metadata keys changed: `startTime`/`endTime` → `after`/`before`
  - Note: Interaction object fields (`startTime`/`endTime`) are unchanged
- **BREAKING**: CLI: `interaction ls` now requires `--type` (was optional but API required it).
- CLI: `interaction ls` date range now defaults to all-time when `--days` and `--after` are omitted.
- **BREAKING**: CLI: `interaction ls` removed `--cursor` and `--all` flags (auto-chunking replaces manual pagination).
- **BREAKING**: CLI: `interaction ls` output field renamed `modifiers.type` → `modifiers.types` (now always an array).
- **BREAKING**: CLI: `interaction ls` metadata `chunksProcessed` moved to `typeStats[type].chunksProcessed`.
- **BREAKING**: CLI: Naive datetime strings (without timezone) are now interpreted as **local time** instead of UTC. Use explicit `Z` suffix or offset for UTC. See [datetime-handling guide](https://yaniv-golan.github.io/affinity-sdk/latest/guides/datetime-handling/) for details.
- **BREAKING**: CLI: List entry field commands unified into single `entry field` command:
  - `entry set-field --field F --value V` → `entry field --set F V`
  - `entry set-field --field F --value-json '{...}'` → `entry field --set-json '{"F": ...}'`
  - `entry set-fields --updates-json '{...}'` → `entry field --set-json '{...}'`
  - `entry unset-field --field F` → `entry field --unset F`
  - `entry unset-field --field F --value V` → `entry field --unset-value F V`
  - `entry unset-field --field F --all-values` → `entry field --unset F`
  - Removed: `--field-id` option (field IDs can be passed as FIELD argument directly)
  - **Behavior change:** `--set` on multi-value field now replaces all values (use `--append` to add)
