## Messaging Framework

### Tagline
> "The Secure Nervous System for Cloud-Native Agent Ecosystems"

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
> AI agents are the fastest-growing identity category in enterprise, but they're also the least governed. AgentMesh provides identity, trust, governance, and adaptive learning for multi-agent systems - ensuring that when your Microsoft agent talks to an external vendor's agent, you know exactly who it is, what it's allowed to do, and that it stayed within bounds.

### Key Messages

1. **For Security Teams:** "Zero-trust for AI agents. Every agent gets a cryptographic identity, every action is audited, and credentials expire in 15 minutes."

2. **For Platform Engineers:** "One command to govern any agent. Works with A2A, MCP, and any protocol."

3. **For Compliance Officers:** "Automated compliance mapping for EU AI Act, SOC 2, HIPAA, and GDPR. Tamper-evident audit logs you can hand to auditors."

4. **For Executives:** "The agents are already shipping. The governance isn't. We fill that gap."

## Competitive Positioning

| Competitor | Their Focus | Our Differentiation |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Microsoft Entra Agent ID | Agent registration | We add reward learning + compliance |
| Descope | MCP OAuth | We're protocol-agnostic |
| Aembit | Workload IAM | We have governance + adaptive learning |
| PwC Agent OS | Enterprise orchestration | We're open + protocol-native |
