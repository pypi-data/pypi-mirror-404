           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.

              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# kokorog2p

A unified multi-language G2P (Grapheme-to-Phoneme) library for Kokoro TTS.

kokorog2p converts text to phonemes optimized for the Kokoro text-to-speech system. It
provides:

- **Multi-language support**: English (US/GB), German, French, Italian, Spanish,
  Portuguese (Brazilian), Czech, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Hebrew
- **Mixed-language preprocessing**: Detect languages for per-word language switching
- **Dictionary-based lookup** with comprehensive lexicons
  - English: 179k+ entries (gold tier), 187k+ silver tier (both loaded by default)
  - German: 738k+ entries from Olaph/IPA-Dict
  - French: Gold-tier dictionary
  - Portuguese (Brazilian): Rule-based with affrication support
  - Italian, Spanish: Rule-based with small lexicons
  - Czech, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Hebrew: Rule-based and specialized engines
- **Flexible memory usage**: Control dictionary loading with `load_silver` and
  `load_gold` parameters
  - Disable silver: saves ~22-31 MB
  - Disable both: saves ~50+ MB for ultra-fast initialization
- **espeak-ng integration** as a fallback for out-of-vocabulary words
- **Automatic IPA to Kokoro phoneme conversion**
- **Automatic punctuation normalization** (ellipsis, dashes, apostrophes)
- **Context-aware abbreviation expansion** (e.g., "St." → "Street" or "Saint" based on
  context)
- **Number and currency handling** for supported languages
- **Stress assignment** based on linguistic rules

## Installation

```bash
# Core package (no dependencies)
pip install kokorog2p

# With English support
pip install kokorog2p[en]

# With German support
pip install kokorog2p[de]

# With French support
pip install kokorog2p[fr]

# With multilang preprocessing support
pip install kokorog2p[mixed]

# With espeak-ng backend
pip install kokorog2p[espeak]

# With goruut backend
pip install kokorog2p[goruut]

# Full installation (all languages and backends)
pip install kokorog2p[all]
```

## Quick Start

```python
from kokorog2p import phonemize

# English (US)
phonemes = phonemize("Hello world!", language="en-us")
print(phonemes)  # həlˈoʊ wˈɜːld!

# British English
phonemes = phonemize("Hello world!", language="en-gb")
print(phonemes)  # həlˈəʊ wˈɜːld!

# German
phonemes = phonemize("Guten Tag!", language="de")
print(phonemes)  # ɡuːtn̩ taːk!

# French
phonemes = phonemize("Bonjour!", language="fr")
print(phonemes)

# Italian
phonemes = phonemize("Ciao, come stai?", language="it")
print(phonemes)  # ʧiao, kome stai?

# Spanish
phonemes = phonemize("¡Hola! ¿Cómo estás?", language="es")
print(phonemes)  # !ola! ?koˈmo estaˈs?

# Chinese
phonemes = phonemize("你好", language="zh")
print(phonemes)

# Korean
phonemes = phonemize("안녕하세요", language="ko")
print(phonemes)

# Hebrew (requires phonikud package)
phonemes = phonemize("שָׁלוֹם", language="he")
print(phonemes)
```

## Advanced Usage

```python
from kokorog2p import get_g2p

# English with default settings (gold + silver dictionaries)
g2p_en = get_g2p("en-us", use_espeak_fallback=True)
tokens = g2p_en("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.")
for token in tokens:
    print(f"{token.text} → {token.phonemes}")

# Memory-optimized: disable silver (~22-31 MB saved, ~400-470 ms faster init)
g2p_fast = get_g2p("en-us", load_silver=False)
tokens = g2p_fast("Hello world!")

# Ultra-fast initialization: disable both gold and silver (~50+ MB saved)
# Falls back to espeak for all words
g2p_minimal = get_g2p("en-us", load_silver=False, load_gold=False)
tokens = g2p_minimal("Hello world!")

# Different dictionary configurations
# load_gold=True, load_silver=True:  Maximum coverage (default)
# load_gold=True, load_silver=False: Common words only, faster
# load_gold=False, load_silver=True: Extended vocabulary only (unusual)
# load_gold=False, load_silver=False: No dictionaries, espeak only (fastest)

# Error handling with strict mode (default: strict=True)
# Strict mode raises clear exceptions for debugging issues
g2p_strict = get_g2p("en-us", backend="espeak", strict=True)
# If espeak fails: RuntimeError with detailed error message

# Lenient mode for backward compatibility (logs errors, returns empty results)
g2p_lenient = get_g2p("en-us", backend="espeak", strict=False)
# If espeak fails: logs error, returns empty string (no exception)

# Automatic punctuation normalization
g2p = get_g2p("en-us")
tokens = g2p("Wait... really?")       # ... → … (ellipsis)
tokens = g2p("Wait - what?")          # - → — (em dash when spaced)
tokens = g2p("don't worry")           # All apostrophe variants → '
tokens = g2p("well-known topic")      # Hyphens in compounds preserved

# Context-aware abbreviation expansion (English)
# "St." intelligently expands to "Street" or "Saint" based on context
g2p = get_g2p("en-us", expand_abbreviations=True, enable_context_detection=True)
tokens = g2p("123 Main St.")          # St. → Street (house number pattern)
tokens = g2p("St. Patrick's Day")     # St. → Saint (saint name recognized)
tokens = g2p("Visit St. Louis")       # St. → Saint (city name recognized)
tokens = g2p("Born in 1850, St. Peter")  # St. → Saint (distant number ignored)

# German with lexicon and number handling
g2p_de = get_g2p("de")
tokens = g2p_de("Es kostet 42 Euro.")
for token in tokens:
    print(f"{token.text} → {token.phonemes}")

# French with fallback support
g2p_fr = get_g2p("fr", use_espeak_fallback=True)
tokens = g2p_fr("C'est magnifique!")
for token in tokens:
    print(f"{token.text} → {token.phonemes}")
```

## Error Handling and Debugging

kokorog2p provides robust error handling to help you debug issues, especially in CI/CD
environments.

### Strict Mode (Default, Recommended)

By default, kokorog2p uses **strict mode** (`strict=True`), which raises clear
exceptions when backend initialization or phonemization fails:

```python
from kokorog2p import get_g2p

# Strict mode is the default
g2p = get_g2p("en-us", backend="espeak", strict=True)

try:
    result = g2p.phonemize("test")
except RuntimeError as e:
    # Get detailed error message about what went wrong
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    # Example: "Espeak backend validation failed. Please ensure espeak-ng
    # is properly installed and voice 'en-us' is available."
```

**Benefits:**

- Catches configuration issues immediately
- Provides actionable error messages
- Prevents silent failures in CI/CD pipelines
- Recommended for production use

### Lenient Mode (Backward Compatible)

For backward compatibility with older versions that silently failed, you can use
**lenient mode** (`strict=False`):

```python
from kokorog2p import get_g2p

# Lenient mode logs errors but doesn't raise exceptions
g2p = get_g2p("en-us", backend="espeak", strict=False)

result = g2p.phonemize("test")
# If espeak fails:
# - Error is logged to Python's logging system
# - Returns empty string "" instead of raising exception
# - Allows your application to continue running
```

**When to use lenient mode:**

- Migrating from older versions (< 0.4.0)
- Non-critical applications where empty results are acceptable
- When you have your own error handling logic

### Common Error Scenarios

**espeak-ng not installed:**

```python
# Strict mode (default)
g2p = get_g2p("en-us", backend="espeak")
# RuntimeError: Espeak backend validation failed. Please ensure espeak-ng
# is properly installed...

# Solution: Install espeak-ng
# Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install espeak-ng
# macOS: brew install espeak
# Windows: Download from https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/releases
```

**Invalid voice:**

```python
from kokorog2p.espeak_g2p import EspeakOnlyG2P

g2p = EspeakOnlyG2P(language="xx-invalid")
# RuntimeError: Espeak backend validation failed...voice 'xx-invalid' is unavailable
```

**CI/CD Best Practices:**

```python
import logging

# Configure logging to see error details
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Use strict mode in CI to catch issues early
g2p = get_g2p("en-us", backend="espeak", strict=True)

# Your CI will fail with clear error messages if there are issues
```

## Pipeline-Friendly API (NEW)

kokorog2p now provides a **span-based phonemization API** designed for integration with
text processing pipelines. This API uses character offsets for deterministic override
application and supports per-token language switching.

### Key Features

- **Offset-based alignment**: Handles duplicate words correctly (e.g., "the cat the
  dog")
- **Direct token ID output**: Ready for model input without post-processing
- **Per-token language switching**: Mix languages within a single sentence
- **Comprehensive warnings**: Debug alignment issues with detailed feedback
- **Backward compatible**: Legacy word-based alignment still available

### Quick Example

```python
from kokorog2p import phonemize, OverrideSpan

# Simple phonemization
result = phonemize("Hello world!")
print(result.phonemes)    # 'həlˈoʊ wˈɜɹld!'
print(result.token_ids)   # [50, 83, 54, ...]

# Handle duplicate words with different pronunciations
text = "the cat the dog"
overrides = [
    OverrideSpan(0, 3, {"ph": "ðə"}),   # First "the"
    OverrideSpan(8, 11, {"ph": "ði"}),  # Second "the"
]
result = phonemize(text, overrides=overrides)
# Both overrides applied correctly!

# Language switching within text
text = "Hello Bonjour world"
overrides = [OverrideSpan(6, 13, {"lang": "fr"})]
result = phonemize(text, lang="en-us", overrides=overrides)
# "Bonjour" phonemized with French G2P
```

### Documentation

- **[API Reference](docs/api.md)** - Complete function documentation
- **[Span Guide](docs/spans.md)** - Understanding character offsets and alignment
- **[Marker Helper](docs/markers.md)** - Convenient marker-based override syntax
- **[Examples](examples/)** - Working code examples

### Use Cases

✅ **Pipeline Integration**: Preserve offsets through preprocessing stages ✅
**Duplicate Handling**: Apply different pronunciations to repeated words ✅
**Multi-language**: Switch languages per-word within sentences ✅ **Model Input**: Get
token IDs directly without manual conversion ✅ **Debugging**: Comprehensive warnings
for alignment issues

## Mixed-Language Preprocessing

kokorog2p provides a standalone multilang preprocessor that detects word-level languages
with `lingua-language-detector` and generates `OverrideSpan` objects for per-word
language switching.

### Installation

```bash
# Install with language detection support
pip install kokorog2p[mixed]

# Or install lingua directly
pip install lingua-language-detector
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from kokorog2p import phonemize
from kokorog2p.multilang import preprocess_multilang

text = "Ich gehe zum Meeting. Let's discuss the Roadmap!"
clean_text, overrides = preprocess_multilang(
    text,
    default_language="de",
    allowed_languages=["de", "en-us"],
)
result = phonemize(clean_text, lang="de", overrides=overrides)
```

### Confidence Threshold

```python
from kokorog2p.multilang import preprocess_multilang

annotated = preprocess_multilang(
    "Hello! Bonjour! Hola!",
    default_language="en-us",
    allowed_languages=["en-us", "de", "fr", "es"],
    confidence_threshold=0.6,
)
```

### Limitations

- Very short words (<3 chars) keep the default language
- Proper nouns may be misdetected
- Requires `lingua-language-detector` installation
- Detected language must be in `allowed_languages`

### Example: Technical Documentation

```python
from kokorog2p import phonemize_to_result
from kokorog2p.multilang import preprocess_multilang

text = """
Das System verwendet Machine Learning für die Performance-Optimierung.
Der Workflow ist sehr efficient durch das Caching.
"""

clean_text, overrides = preprocess_multilang(
    text,
    default_language="de",
    allowed_languages=["de", "en-us"],
)
result = phonemize_to_result(clean_text, lang="de", overrides=overrides)
print(result.phonemes)
```

**Note:** Both gold and silver dictionaries are loaded by default for English. You can:

- Use `load_silver=False` to save ~22-31 MB (gold only, ~179k entries)
- Use `load_gold=False, load_silver=False` to save ~50+ MB (espeak fallback only)

**Chinese Note:** Chinese G2P uses Zhuyin (Bopomofo) phonetic notation for Kokoro TTS
compatibility. Arabic numerals are automatically converted to Chinese (e.g., "123" → "一
百二十三"). For version 1.1 (recommended):

```python
from kokorog2p.zh import ChineseG2P
g2p = ChineseG2P(version="1.1")  # Uses ZHFrontend with Zhuyin notation
```

**Spanish Note:** Spanish G2P supports both European and Latin American dialects:

```python
from kokorog2p.es import SpanishG2P

# European Spanish (with theta θ)
g2p_es = SpanishG2P(dialect="es")
print(g2p_es.phonemize("zapato"))  # θapato

# Latin American Spanish (seseo: θ→s)
g2p_la = SpanishG2P(dialect="la")
print(g2p_la.phonemize("zapato"))  # sapato
```

Key features: R trill/tap distinction (pero vs perro), palatals (ñ, ll, ch), jota sound
(j), and proper stress marking.

**Korean Note:** Korean G2P works out of the box with rule-based phonemization. For
improved accuracy with morphological analysis, install MeCab:

```bash
pip install mecab-python3
```

**Hebrew Note:** Hebrew G2P requires the phonikud package for phonemization:

```bash
pip install kokorog2p[he]
# or directly:
pip install phonikud
```

Note: Hebrew text should include nikud (diacritical marks) for accurate phonemization.
