This module allows to adjust the valuation of the incoming goods related
to their purchase order from the purchase line itself.

Use Cases / Context
===================

When a purchase order is confirmed, the value of the received goods is
updated upon reception. It can happen anyway that the reception of the
goods is confirmed before the final price is recorded in the
corresponding purchase line.

For that, Odoo will fix the valuation when the invoice for that purchase
is confirmed, but that moment could be delayed for an uncertain period
of time while thos stored goods are being selled with wrong margins and
the value being discounted for a wrong price unit.

We want to fix those disalignments as soon as possible from the purchase
order while keeping the native mechanism to add later corrections from
the invoice itself.

Configuration
=============

In order to use this module, you need to have some storable products
valued on average cost (AVCO).

To do so:

- Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Product Categories* and select one.
- In the **Inventory valuation** section, select the **Costing method**
  as **Average Cost (AVCO)**.
- Now all the products in that category will have that valuation rules.

Usage
=====

In order to test the module:

- Go to *Purchase > Orders* and create a new quotation.
- Add a product with AVCO valuation and set a price.
- Validate the purchase order.
- Receive the products.
- The products are now valued at the price you set in the order line.
- You can check it in *Inventory > Reporting > Valuation* (debug mode
  needed).
- Now change the price in the order line.
- You'll see that the line has changed its color to yellow and a new
  button *Fix valuation* shows up in the header.
- When you click that button, every disaligned valuation will be fixed.
  If you go to the *Valuation* report you'll see the adjustment layer.
- After this, when you invoice the purchase you won't be able to edit
  the price anymore.
- You can anyway add an additional valuation when you post the new
  invoice prices.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- Only AVCO is supported
