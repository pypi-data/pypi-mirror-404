Integration tests for password reset on BOTH Community and Enterprise editions.

Constitutional Principle #6: "Enterprise Ready, Community Friendly"

These tests verify that the password reset functionality works identically
on both Community and Enterprise editions of IRIS.

CRITICAL: These tests use the `iris_db_both_editions` parametrized fixture
which runs each test twice: once with Community, once with Enterprise.

Tests verify:
- T001: Password reset works on both editions
- T002: Security.Users API is identical on both editions
- T003: DBAPI connections work on both editions after password reset
- T004: Performance SLA (<100ms typical) met on both editions
