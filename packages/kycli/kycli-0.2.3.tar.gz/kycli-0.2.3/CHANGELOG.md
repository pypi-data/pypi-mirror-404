# Changelog

## [0.1.8] - 2026-01-08
### Added
- **Community Standards**: Added Code of Conduct, Contributing Guide, Security Policy, Issue Templates, and PR Template.
- **Branding**: Official KyCLI Logo added to repository and README.
- **Improved Test Suite**: Modularized test structure (`tests/core`, `tests/interface`, `tests/integration`) and cleaned up root directory.
- **JSONPath & Dot-Notation Querying**: Native support for nested object retrieval (e.g., `kyg user.profile.email`).
- **List-Index & Slicing Support**: Access specific list elements or ranges directly (e.g., `kyg logs[0:10]`).
- **Atomic Partial Updates (Patching)**: Update specific fields in deep JSON structures without rewriting the entire object via `patch()`.
- **Advanced Collection Operations**: New `kypush` and `kyrem` commands for managed list operations (append/remove) with optional uniqueness checks.
- **Enhanced TUI Documentation**: Full feature documentation integrated directly into the `kyshell` results pane.
- **TUI Feature Parity**: Implemented missing commands (`kyfo`, `kyrt`, `kyco`) in the interactive shell.

### Changed
- **CLI Refactor**: Merged `kyf` (search) into `kyg` using the `-s/--search` flag for a more unified experience.
- **Project Structure**: Organized resource files into `tests/resources` and split internal Cython modules for better maintainability.
- **Documentation**: Updated README to reflect new commands and logo.

### Fixed
- **Kycore Type Consistency**: Fixed a Cython type-hinting issue in `save()` for existing key lookups.
- **TUI Help Visibility**: Increased result pane height to accommodate full documentation displays.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-01-07
### Added
- **Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)**: Introduced "Time Machine" capabilities via `restore_to(timestamp)` and the `kyrt` command. Allows full database reconstruction from any point in the audit log.
- **Database Compaction**: Added `compact(retention_days)` and the `kyco` command to optimize storage, purge stale history/archive data, and reclaim disk space using SQLite `VACUUM`.
- **Encryption at Rest**: Implemented transparent **AES-256-GCM** encryption using standardMaster Keys or `KYCLI_MASTER_KEY` environment variable.
- **Value-Level TTL (Time To Live)**: Keys can now have an expiration time (e.g., `kys session_id "data" --ttl 1h`). Supports human-readable suffixes: `s`, `m`, `h`, `d`, `w`, `M`, `y`.
- **Atomic Batch Save (`save_many`)**: Optimized internal API for ultra-fast bulk data ingest in single transactions.
- **Enhanced L1 Cache**: Hybrid LRU cache now supports sub-second TTL precision and microsecond-level hit rates ($1.5 \mu s$).
- **100% Code Coverage**: Achieved and verified 100% test coverage across all core Python modules.

### Fixed
- **SQLite Binding Fix**: Resolved an issue where `None` values were incorrectly bound as strings; now correctly handled as `SQLITE_NULL`.
- **Async API Returns**: Fixed return value consistency for `save_async()` and `getkey_async()`.
- **Tombstone Reliability**: Deletions now explicitly log tombstones in the audit log to support historical recovery.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-01-05
### Fixed
- **ModuleNotFoundError Fix**: Fixed critical installation issue where `kycli.kycore` module was not found after pip installation
- **Build System**: Updated setup.py to properly handle Cython compilation with fallback to pre-generated C files
- **Dependencies**: Added missing `install_requires` for prompt-toolkit, rich, and tomli
- **Distribution**: Ensured generated C files are included in source distributions for users without Cython

## [0.1.5] - 2026-01-04
### Added
- **Structured Types (JSON)**: Native support for Python dicts and lists. Values are automatically serialized to JSON on save and deserialized on retrieval.
- **Full-Text Search (FTS5)**: Added `kyf` command and `.search()` method for ultra-fast Google-like searching across the entire store.
- **Pydantic Integration**: Link a Pydantic model to `Kycore` for automatic schema validation on every `save` operation.
- **Environment Variable Configuration**: Set `KYCLI_DB_PATH` to customize the database location dynamically.
- **Execute Mode (kyc)**: Run stored values directly as shell commands, supporting both static and dynamic execution.
- **Interactive TUI Shell (kyshell)**: Multi-pane terminal interface with real-time audit trails and background command execution.
- **Archiving & Auto-Purge**: Deleted keys are now moved to a secure `archive` table with a 15-day auto-purge policy.
- **Safe Deletion**: `kyd` now requires re-entering the key name for confirmation.
- **Accident Recovery**: Added `kyr` (restore) command to magically recover deleted keys from the archive.
- **100% Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite covering all edge cases, CLI commands, and TUI interactions.
- **Improved CLI UX**: Detailed help examples (`kyh`), emojis, and micro-animations in the TUI.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-01-03
### Added
- **Integration Documentation**: Added detailed examples for using `Kycore` in custom classes and FastAPI applications.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-01-03
### Changed
- **Metadata Update**: Refreshed README and PyPI documentation to accurately reflect Raw C API optimizations (direct `libsqlite3` binding).

## [0.1.2] - 2026-01-03
### Added
- **C-Level Core**: Replaced Python `sqlite3` with direct C API calls for 150x faster retrieval.
- **Async Support**: Added non-blocking `save_async` and `getkey_async` for high-throughput app integration.
- **Performance Suite**: Integrated a new benchmark script and performance reporting.
- **Improved Typing**: Enhanced Cython type definitions for critical paths.
