# About KymFlow

KymFlow is a tool for analyzing kymograph blood flow data from laser scanning microscopy experiments.

## Overview

KymFlow provides both a desktop GUI application and a Python API for working with kymograph TIFF files. The tool enables researchers to:

- Load and visualize kymograph images
- Edit experimental metadata
- Perform Radon-based flow analysis to detect flow direction and velocity
- Process multiple files in batch mode
- Export analysis results for further processing

## Features

- **Intuitive GUI**: Browse, analyze, and manage kymograph files with an easy-to-use interface
- **Batch Processing**: Analyze multiple files sequentially with progress tracking
- **Metadata Management**: Edit and save experimental metadata alongside analysis results
- **Python API**: Use the backend programmatically in scripts and Jupyter notebooks
- **Radon Flow Analysis**: Detect flow direction and velocity using Radon transforms
