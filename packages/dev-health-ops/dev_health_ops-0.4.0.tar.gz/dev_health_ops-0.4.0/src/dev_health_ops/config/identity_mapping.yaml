# Optional identity aliases for consistent per-user metrics across providers.
#
# Canonical identities should be stable and human-meaningful (prefer email).
# Aliases can include:
# - provider-qualified usernames: "github:octocat", "gitlab:alice"
# - Jira account IDs: "jira:accountid:abcd1234"
# - Display names when emails are unavailable
#
# This file ships empty by default; populate for your org.
