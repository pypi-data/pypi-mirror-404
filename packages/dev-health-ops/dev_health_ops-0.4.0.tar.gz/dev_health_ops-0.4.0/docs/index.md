# dev-health-ops

Developer health and operations analytics, built to be transparent, affordable, and useful.

## Why this exists

Developer health tooling drifted into expensive, opaque scoring systems that are easy to misuse. This project is intentionally different.

- Accessibility over extraction
- Learning, not judgment
- Trends over absolutes
- Inspectable by default

## What you can do here

- Sync data from GitHub, GitLab, Jira, and local Git repositories.
- Normalize and store work items, commits, and blame data.
- Compute metrics like throughput, cycle time, rework, and predictability.
- Explore optional Grafana dashboards for hotspots, investment flow, and team health (panel plugin moved to `dev-health-panels`).
