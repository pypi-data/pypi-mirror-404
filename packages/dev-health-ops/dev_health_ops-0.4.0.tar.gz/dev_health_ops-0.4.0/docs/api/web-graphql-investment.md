# Web: GraphQL investment usage

Source: `dev-health-web/docs/graphql-investment.md`

This is the frontend usage and shape expectations for investment views, including:
- Dimension keys (THEME/SUBCATEGORY)
- Sankey request shape
- Response parsing conventions

Keep this aligned with:
- backend taxonomy (`investment_taxonomy.py`)
- GraphQL inputs/outputs (`api/graphql/models/*`)
