# Views and Charts

Each view answers a specific operational question. Views are explanations with drill-down, not a wall of widgets.

## Core views
- Investment Mix (treemap/sunburst)
- Investment Flows (sankey)
- Investment Expense (stacked area)
- Code Hotspots (heatmap/treemap/sunburst)
- PR Flow (stage breakdown)
- Quadrants (raw-value state classification)
- Flame diagrams (single-point decomposition)
- Work Graph (entity relationships, related entities)

## Interpretation rules
- Trends over snapshots.
- Compare within the same window + filter context.
- Treat “unknown/unclassified” as a pipeline bug, not an output.
