"""
SubagentSpawner tool for RalphLoop.

This tool allows the primary agent to spawn disposable worker agents
for expensive operations like searching codebase, writing code, etc.

According to the Ralph architecture:
- Subagents have their own context window (~150kb)
- Subagents are garbage collected after completion
- Subagents have access to: read_file, write_file, search, run_command
- Test/Build subagents are bottlenecked (only one at a time)

## Your Purpose
You are a {purpose} subagent. Complete the assigned task efficiently and return a concise result.

## Workspace
Working directory: {workspace}
All file paths are relative to this directory. Use "src/main.py" not "{workspace}/src/main.py".

## Available Context
{context}

## Key Rules

1. **For EXISTING files**: Read the file first before editing to understand structure
2. **For NEW files**: Just write them directly with proper structure
3. **No placeholders**: Implement fully, no "pass" or "TODO"
4. **Proper Python structure**: Imports at top, proper indentation (4 spaces)
5. **Be efficient**: Complete the task and return results concisely
6. **Do NOT get stuck**: If searching finds nothing, report "not found" and stop

## Writing Code

When writing Python files:
- Put ALL imports at the TOP
- Use 4-space indentation
- Keep methods inside their class
- Include proper type annotations
- Write complete, runnable code
