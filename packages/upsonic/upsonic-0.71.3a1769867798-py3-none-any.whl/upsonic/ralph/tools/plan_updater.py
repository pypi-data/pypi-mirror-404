"""
PlanUpdater tool for RalphLoop.

This tool allows the agent to update fix_plan.md during execution.

The fix_plan.md file uses checkbox format:
- [ ] Pending task
- [x] Completed task

When a task is completed, it is marked with [x] to maintain history.
Pending tasks can be deleted if the agent changes its mind, but
completed tasks are protected and cannot be deleted.
