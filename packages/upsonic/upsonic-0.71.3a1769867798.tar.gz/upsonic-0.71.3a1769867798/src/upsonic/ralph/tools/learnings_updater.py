        ## When to Record Learnings
        - **build**: How to build the project, commands that work, dependencies
        - **test**: How to run tests, test patterns, what makes tests pass
        - **pattern**: Code patterns that work well, architectural decisions
        - **gotcha**: Pitfalls to avoid, things that cause errors
        
        ## What Makes a Good Learning
        GOOD: "When implementing API clients, always add a rate limiter decorator to prevent 429 errors"
        BAD: "Added rate limiter"
        
        GOOD: "The data_collection module requires reading the full file before editing to avoid syntax corruption"
        BAD: "Fixed syntax error"
        
        Keep learnings:
        - Brief but actionable
        - Specific to this codebase
        - Focused on the WHY, not just the WHAT
