        While there aren't actual headers per socket message when using it as transition protocol, to make it feel more like http call

        Payload field is designed to be used as main data storage. It's supposed to mostly contain a dictionary (the message
        object itself is Json coded and decoded so the rest data are not Json Coded), however any other value is possible
        like string, int, float, even a simple boolean or a huge base64 encoded string.
