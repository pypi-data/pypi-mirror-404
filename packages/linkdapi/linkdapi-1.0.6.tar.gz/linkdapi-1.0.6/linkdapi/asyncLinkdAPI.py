class AsyncLinkdAPI:
    """
    An async high-level client for interacting with the LinkdAPI service.

    This async client provides the same functionality as LinkdAPI but with async/await support:
    - Automatic retry mechanism for failed requests
    - Type-annotated methods for better IDE support
    - Connection pooling for improved performance
    - Comprehensive error handling
    - Async context manager support

    Basic Usage:
    -----------
    The recommended way to use this client is with async context manager:

    ```python
    async with AsyncLinkdAPI(api_key="your_api_key") as api:
        profile = await api.get_profile_overview("ryanroslansky")
        print(profile)
    ```

    Or for long-lived clients:
    ```python
    api = AsyncLinkdAPI(api_key="your_api_key")
    try:
        profile = await api.get_profile_overview("ryanroslansky")
        print(profile)
    finally:
        await api.close()
    ```

    Args:
        api_key (str): Your LinkdAPI authentication key. Get one at https://linkdapi.com/?p=signup
        base_url (str): Base URL for the API (default: "https://linkdapi.com")
        timeout (float): Request timeout in seconds (default: 30)
        max_retries (int): Maximum retry attempts for failed requests (default: 3)
        retry_delay (float): Initial delay between retries in seconds (default: 1)
                         Note: Delay increases exponentially with each retry

    Raises:
        httpx.HTTPStatusError: For 4xx/5xx responses after all retries
        httpx.RequestError: For network-related errors after all retries

    Example:
    ```python
    import asyncio

    async def main():
        async with AsyncLinkdAPI(api_key="your_key") as api:
            try:
                # Get profile data
                profile = await api.get_profile_overview("ryanroslansky")
                if profile.get("success", False):
                    print(f"Profile Name: {profile['data']['fullName']}")

            except httpx.HTTPStatusError as e:
                print(f"API Error: {e.response.status_code} - {e.response.text}")
            except httpx.RequestError as e:
                print(f"Network Error: {str(e)}")

    asyncio.run(main())
