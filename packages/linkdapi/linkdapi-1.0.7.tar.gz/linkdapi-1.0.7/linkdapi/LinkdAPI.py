class LinkdAPI:
    """
    A high-level client for interacting with the LinkdAPI service.
    
    This client provides:
    - Automatic retry mechanism for failed requests
    - Type-annotated methods for better IDE support
    - Connection pooling for improved performance
    - Comprehensive error handling
    - Both context manager and direct usage patterns
    
    Basic Usage:
    -----------
    There are two recommended ways to use this client:
    
    1. Context Manager (Recommended for most cases):
    ```python
    with LinkdAPI(api_key="your_api_key") as api:
        profile = api.get_profile_overview("ryanroslansky")
        print(profile)
    ```
    
    2. Direct Instantiation (When you need long-lived clients):
    ```python
    api = LinkdAPI(api_key="your_api_key")
    try:
        profile = api.get_profile_overview("ryanroslansky")
        print(profile)
    finally:
        api.close()
    ```
    
    Args:
        api_key (str): Your LinkdAPI authentication key. Get one at https://linkdapi.com/?p=signup
        base_url (str): Base URL for the API (default: "https://linkdapi.com")
        timeout (float): Request timeout in seconds (default: 30)
        max_retries (int): Maximum retry attempts for failed requests (default: 3)
        retry_delay (float): Initial delay between retries in seconds (default: 1)
                         Note: Delay increases exponentially with each retry
    
    Raises:
        httpx.HTTPStatusError: For 4xx/5xx responses after all retries
        httpx.RequestError: For network-related errors after all retries
    
    Example:
    ```python
    # Basic usage with context manager
    with LinkdAPI(api_key="your_key") as api:
        try:
            # Get profile data
            profile = api.get_profile_overview("ryanroslansky")
            if profile.get("success", False):
                print(f"Profile Name: {profile['data']['fullName']}")
            
        except httpx.HTTPStatusError as e:
            print(f"API Error: {e.response.status_code} - {e.response.text}")
        except httpx.RequestError as e:
            print(f"Network Error: {str(e)}")
