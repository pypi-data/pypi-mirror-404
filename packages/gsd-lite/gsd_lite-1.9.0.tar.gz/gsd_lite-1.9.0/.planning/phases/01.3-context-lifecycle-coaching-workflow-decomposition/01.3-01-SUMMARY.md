# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 01.3-RESEARCH
    provides: Workflow decomposition patterns and coaching philosophy from OG GSD analysis
provides:
  - Moodboard workflow (dream extraction/questioning mode)
  - Whiteboard workflow (plan proposal/scope confirmation mode)
  - Identical sticky note protocol across both workflows for universal orientation
affects: [01.3-02, 01.3-03, 01.3-04, 01.3-05]

# Tech tracking

key-decisions:

patterns-established:
  - "Entry/exit conditions: Every workflow declares when to load and what triggers next workflow"
  - "Systematic IDs in all examples: PHASE-NNN, TASK-NNN format throughout"

# Phase 01.3 Plan 01: Planning Mode Workflow Extraction Summary

**Moodboard (dream extraction) and Whiteboard (plan proposal) workflows extracted from monolithic PROTOCOL.md with identical sticky note orientation protocol**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 4 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-25T08:29:11Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-25T08:32:43Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments

- Created self-contained moodboard.md workflow (289 lines) for dream extraction/questioning mode
- Created self-contained whiteboard.md workflow (285 lines) for plan proposal/scope confirmation
- Both workflows include identical sticky note protocol for universal orientation
- Combined line count (574 lines) well under 700-line target, avoiding monolithic problem

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create moodboard.md workflow** - `0df5439` (feat)
   - Dream extraction mode from PROTOCOL.md
   - Questioning protocol with 10x emoji banners
   - Context checklist, decision gate, anti-patterns
   - Identical sticky note section

2. **Task 2: Create whiteboard.md workflow** - `dad1b04` (feat)
   - Plan proposal mode from PROTOCOL.md
   - Governance framework table for autonomy decisions
   - Scope confirmation and adjustment protocols
   - Identical sticky note section

## Files Created/Modified

- `gsd-lite/workflows/moodboard.md` - Dream extraction mode with collaborative questioning protocol
- `gsd-lite/workflows/whiteboard.md` - Plan proposal mode with scope confirmation and governance framework
- `.gitignore` - Removed gsd-lite from ignore list to allow workflow file tracking

## Decisions Made

**1. Removed gsd-lite from .gitignore**
- **Context:** gsd-lite directory was being ignored, preventing workflow file commits
- **Decision:** Removed from .gitignore to enable version control of template and workflow files
- **Rationale:** Workflow files are core deliverables that need to be tracked in repository

**2. Workflow file structure**
- **Context:** Need to balance completeness with cognitive load prevention
- **Decision:** Target 200-300 lines per workflow, link to references for deep-dives
- **Rationale:** Research shows agents skip critical sections in 930-line monolithic protocols

**3. Sticky note section placement**
- **Context:** Universal orientation mechanism needs to appear in every workflow
- **Decision:** Include identical sticky note section (verbatim) at end of each workflow
- **Rationale:** Provides consistent orientation regardless of which workflow agent loads

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Removed gsd-lite from .gitignore**
- **Found during:** Task 1 (attempting to commit moodboard.md)
- **Issue:** Git refused to add gsd-lite/workflows/moodboard.md due to .gitignore entry
- **Fix:** Edited .gitignore to remove "gsd-lite" line
- **Files modified:** .gitignore
- **Verification:** Successfully committed moodboard.md after change
- **Committed in:** 0df5439 (Task 1 commit included this fix)

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (1 blocking issue)
**Impact on plan:** Blocking issue fix necessary to complete task. No scope creep.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

**Ready for Plan 01.3-02:** Extract execution and checkpoint workflows

**Context provided:**
- Moodboard and whiteboard workflows established pattern
- Sticky note section serves as canonical format for other workflows
- Entry/exit conditions pattern ready to apply to execution/checkpoint workflows

**No blockers or concerns**
