# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 01.8-add-workflows-templated-artifacts
    plan: 01
    provides: ARCHITECTURE.md and PROJECT.md templates
provides:
  - map-codebase.md workflow for single-agent codebase mapping
  - new-project.md workflow for conversational project initialization
  - Both workflows follow GSD-lite patterns (coaching, first-turn, sticky notes)
affects: [users can now map codebases and initialize projects using GSD-lite]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "Single-agent sequential mapping (not parallel subagents like OG GSD)"
    - "Conversational project initialization (not Context7/WebSearch heavy)"
    - "Grep-first discovery (ls/find/grep instead of reading every file)"

key-files:
  created:
    - src/gsd_lite/template/workflows/map-codebase.md
    - src/gsd_lite/template/workflows/new-project.md
  modified: []

key-decisions:
  - "map-codebase.md uses 5-step process: discover structure, identify tech, trace data flow, document entry points, write ARCHITECTURE.md"
  - "new-project.md uses 6-step process: extract vision, identify core value, define success criteria, gather context, identify constraints, write PROJECT.md"
  - "Both workflows include Coaching Philosophy from moodboard.md"
  - "Both workflows include First Turn Protocol (talk before writing)"
  - "Both workflows include Sticky Note Protocol (status at every turn)"
  - "Both workflows output to gsd-lite/ directory (user's working directory, not template/)"
  - "Neither workflow uses OG GSD patterns (no spawn_agents, Task tool, subagent_type)"

patterns-established:
  - "Workflow structure: Initialization Check → Entry/Exit Conditions → Coaching Philosophy → First Turn Protocol → Process Steps → Sticky Note Protocol"
  - "Single-agent adaptation: Sequential execution instead of parallel subagent spawning"
  - "Grep-first behavior: Use ls/find/grep to discover before reading files"
  - "Vision Reflection pattern: Agent reflects understanding before writing artifacts"

# Phase 01.8 Plan 02: Create Workflow Files Summary

**Single-agent workflows for codebase mapping and project initialization, adapted from OG GSD patterns to GSD-lite philosophy**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-31T17:58:50Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-31T18:01:57Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files created:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Created map-codebase.md workflow with 5-step mapping process
- Created new-project.md workflow with 6-step initialization process
- Both workflows follow GSD-lite patterns (coaching philosophy, first-turn protocol, sticky notes)
- Both workflows adapted from OG GSD multi-agent patterns to single-agent sequential execution
- Both workflows include Vision Reflection pattern for confirming understanding
- Both workflows output to gsd-lite/ directory (user's working directory)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create map-codebase.md workflow** - `dc4f5bf` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create new-project.md workflow** - `790c3ee` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/gsd_lite/template/workflows/map-codebase.md` - Codebase mapping workflow (302 lines)
- `src/gsd_lite/template/workflows/new-project.md` - Project initialization workflow (423 lines)

## Decisions Made

**map-codebase.md adaptations from OG GSD:**
- OG spawns 4 parallel agents (tech, arch, quality, concerns) → GSD-lite does sequentially in ONE agent
- OG produces 7 files → GSD-lite produces 1 file (ARCHITECTURE.md)
- OG has model profiles → GSD-lite doesn't (single agent context)
- Added Coaching Philosophy section (thinking partners pattern)
- Added First Turn Protocol (talk before mapping)
- Added Sticky Note Protocol (status at every turn)
- Output location: `gsd-lite/ARCHITECTURE.md` (user's working directory, not template)
- Grep-first discovery: Use ls/find/grep instead of reading every file

**new-project.md adaptations from OG GSD:**
- OG uses Context7 MCP and WebSearch → GSD-lite uses simpler questioning
- OG produces complex PROJECT.md with lifecycle tracking → GSD-lite produces lightweight PROJECT.md
- OG has validation checkpoints → GSD-lite uses coaching conversation
- Added Coaching Philosophy section (thinking partners pattern)
- Added First Turn Protocol (talk before writing)
- Added Questioning Protocol (motivation, concreteness, clarification, success)
- Added Vision Reflection pattern (confirm understanding before writing)
- Added Sticky Note Protocol (status at every turn)
- Output location: `gsd-lite/PROJECT.md` (user's working directory, not template)
- Transition to Moodboard section for next steps

**Workflow structure consistency:**
- All GSD-lite workflows now follow same pattern:
  - Initialization Check
  - Entry/Exit Conditions
  - Coaching Philosophy
  - First Turn Protocol
  - Process Steps
  - Sticky Note Protocol
- map-codebase.md and new-project.md join moodboard.md, whiteboard.md, execution.md, checkpoint.md, housekeeping.md

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - workflows are self-contained and follow existing GSD-lite patterns.

## Next Phase Readiness

Ready to use. Users can now:
- Map existing codebases: Agent follows map-codebase.md workflow, produces ARCHITECTURE.md
- Initialize new projects: Agent follows new-project.md workflow, produces PROJECT.md
- Both workflows integrate naturally with existing GSD-lite workflows

No blockers. Both workflows are standalone utilities (not part of moodboard/whiteboard/execution core loop) and can be invoked by natural language requests.
