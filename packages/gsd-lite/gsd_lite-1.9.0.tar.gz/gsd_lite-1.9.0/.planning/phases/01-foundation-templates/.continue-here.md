<current_state>
Running Phase 1 UAT verification via /gsd:verify-work. Currently on Test 5 of 21.

Progress: 3 tests passed, 1 issue found (Test 2 - token budget enforcement), 17 tests pending.

User paused during Test 5 (BOOTLOADER_TEMPLATE sticky note protocol) before providing response.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

**Tests passed:**
- Test 1: LOOPS_TEMPLATE systematic ID format - ✓ pass
- Test 3: STATE_TEMPLATE available actions menu - ✓ pass
- Test 4: Templates use .gsd-lite namespace - ✓ pass

**Issues found:**
- Test 2: CONTEXT_TEMPLATE token budget thresholds - ✗ issue (severity: major)
  - Problem: Templates force agent to "stop and drop context" at >60% budget, but conversational agents can't dynamically drop context mid-session - only option is to start fresh session which loses memory
  - Logged in UAT.md Gaps section for later diagnosis and fix planning

</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

**Pending tests (18):**
- Test 5: BOOTLOADER_TEMPLATE sticky note protocol (awaiting user response)
- Test 6: BOOTLOADER includes loop source clarification
- Test 7: SUMMARY_TEMPLATE GTD export mapping
- Test 8: SUMMARY includes realistic examples
- Test 9: README Mermaid workflow diagram
- Test 10: README Getting Started sequence
- Test 11: PROTOCOL_REFERENCE consolidates patterns
- Test 12: PROTOCOL_REFERENCE checkpoint split
- Test 13: AGENTS.md follows standard format
- Test 14: AGENTS.md uses .gsd-lite namespace
- Test 15: Templates include inline education
- Test 16: Templates support dual workflows
- Test 17: CONTEXT window-relative thresholds
- Test 18: LOOPS sources include user questions
- Test 19: All templates cross-reference correctly
- Test 20: README template index clarity
- Test 21: All 8 templates exist in .planning/templates/

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Severity inference for Test 2: "major" (user describes fundamental limitation - can't drop context mid-session)
- UAT file structure: Following verify-work.md template with YAML frontmatter, Current Test section, Tests list, Summary counts, and Gaps section
- Batched file writes: Updating UAT.md after each response to preserve state

</decisions_made>

<blockers>

None currently. UAT process running smoothly, one issue identified but testing continues.

**What we're doing:**
Running conversational UAT on Phase 1 templates (Foundation & Templates). User manually verifies each deliverable, responds with "pass" or describes issues. I infer severity and log gaps for later diagnosis.

**The vibe:**
Testing is straightforward - user checking that templates exist, contain expected content, and follow documented patterns. Test 2 revealed a fundamental design issue with token budget enforcement that will need fixing (templates assume agent can dynamically drop context, but conversational agents can't).

**What happens after UAT:**
1. If all remaining tests pass → Move to next phase
2. If more issues found → After completing all 21 tests:
   - Spawn parallel debug agents to diagnose root causes
   - Spawn gsd-planner to create fix plans from diagnosed gaps
   - Spawn gsd-plan-checker to verify fix plans (max 3 iterations)
   - Present ready status with `/gsd:execute-phase --gaps-only`

</context>

<next_action>

Resume with Test 5: Present checkpoint box asking user to verify BOOTLOADER_TEMPLATE sticky note protocol.

Specific action:
1. Read current test from UAT.md Current Test section
2. Display checkpoint box with test name and expected behavior
3. Wait for user response (pass/issue/skip)
4. Update UAT.md accordingly
5. Move to Test 6

Continue until all 21 tests complete, then follow verify-work.md process for gap diagnosis and fix planning if issues exist.
