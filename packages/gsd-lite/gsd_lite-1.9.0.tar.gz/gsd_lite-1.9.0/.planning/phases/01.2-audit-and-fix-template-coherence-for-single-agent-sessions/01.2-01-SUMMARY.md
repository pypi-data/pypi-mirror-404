plan: 01
subsystem: documentation
tags: [gsd-lite, templates, protocol, workflow, single-agent]

# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 01-foundation-and-templates
    provides: Initial GSD-lite template structure and manifesto concepts
provides:
  - PROTOCOL.md as single entrypoint consolidating MANIFESTO, BOOTLOADER_PROMPT, and BOOTLOADER_TEMPLATE
  - 8 required workflow sections for foolproof single-agent execution
  - 10x emoji moodboard format for visual planning confirmation
  - Golden Rules and concrete examples for weak reasoning models
affects: [01.2-02-onwards, Phase-2-onwards]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "5-file structure: PROTOCOL.md (entrypoint), STATE.md, WORK.md, INBOX.md, HISTORY.md"
    - "Moodboard planning with 10x emoji visual banners"
    - "Sticky reminder at end of every turn for status tracking"
    - "Promote → Record → Trim → Clear lifecycle for phase completion"

key-files:
  created:
    - gsd_lite/PROTOCOL.md
  modified: []

key-decisions:
  - "PROTOCOL.md is immutable entrypoint (never write, always read first)"
  - "Single-read constraint: agents can only read files at first turn"
  - "Loops captured from BOTH user (non-linear thinking) and agent (discovery)"
  - "Aggressive WORK.md trimming after promotion (not archiving)"
  - "Moodboard is mandatory - DO NOT SKIP visual confirmation"

patterns-established:
  - "Interview → Moodboard → Confirmation → Execute workflow"
  - "Visual interrupt pattern: 10x emoji banners for critical attention"
  - "Dual-source loop capture: user questions + agent discoveries"
  - "Artifact lifecycle: Verbose logging → Promote externally → Aggressive trim"

# Phase 01.2 Plan 01: Audit and Fix Template Coherence Summary

**PROTOCOL.md as foolproof bootloader consolidating scattered templates into single entrypoint with 8 workflow sections, Golden Rules, and 10x emoji moodboard for weak reasoning models**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-22T15:46:25Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-22T15:48:40Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Created PROTOCOL.md (339 lines) consolidating MANIFESTO, BOOTLOADER_PROMPT, and BOOTLOADER_TEMPLATE
- Established 8 required sections: Session Start Checklist, File Guide, Golden Rules, Planning Mode, Execution Mode, Loop Capture, Sticky Reminder, Scope Discipline, Promotion Workflow
- Embedded 10x emoji moodboard format with visual boxes for planning confirmation
- Added 5 concrete copy-paste examples for weak reasoning models
- Documented single-read constraint and artifact lifecycle clearly

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create PROTOCOL.md with all required sections** - `b8df0ea` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Add behavioral rules and examples** - _No additional commit (completed in Task 1)_

**Plan metadata:** _Pending final commit_

_Note: Task 2 requirements (Golden Rules, 4+ examples, single-read constraint) were efficiently completed during Task 1 file creation. All done criteria verified._

## Files Created/Modified
- `gsd_lite/PROTOCOL.md` - Single entrypoint bootloader for GSD-lite workflow with complete protocol documentation

## Decisions Made
- **PROTOCOL.md is immutable**: Agents read but never write to protocol file
- **Single-read constraint documented**: Explicitly noted agents can only read files at first turn, requiring self-contained protocol
- **10x emoji moodboard is mandatory**: Visual banner required for every new phase planning
- **Dual-source loop capture**: Loops come from both user (non-linear thinking) and agent (discovery during execution)
- **Aggressive WORK.md trimming**: After promotion, WORK.md is deleted (not archived) - completed work goes to external artifacts

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. Task 1 and Task 2 requirements were completed efficiently in a single comprehensive file creation that met all done criteria for both tasks.

## Issues Encountered

None. Straightforward consolidation of existing template files (MANIFESTO, BOOTLOADER_PROMPT, BOOTLOADER_TEMPLATE) into unified PROTOCOL.md with enhanced structure and examples.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required. PROTOCOL.md is pure documentation artifact.

## Next Phase Readiness

**Ready for Phase 01.2 Plan 02 and beyond:**
- PROTOCOL.md establishes single entrypoint pattern
- Other template files (STATE.md, WORK.md, INBOX.md, HISTORY.md) can now reference PROTOCOL.md as the source of truth
- Behavioral rules and workflow patterns clearly documented for template coherence
- Moodboard format available for copy-paste into other templates

**No blockers.** Template consolidation complete. Ready to proceed with remaining 4 files in 5-file structure (STATE.md, WORK.md, INBOX.md, HISTORY.md templates).
