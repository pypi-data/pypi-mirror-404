# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 01.2-01
    provides: PROTOCOL.md template as single entrypoint
provides:
  - STATE.md template with moderate depth for weak agent resume
  - WORK.md template for verbose execution logging
  - INBOX.md template for loop capture from user and agent
  - HISTORY.md template for minimal completed phase records
affects: [01.2-03-consolidate-redundant-files]

# Tech tracking

  patterns:
    - "5-file GSD-lite structure: PROTOCOL + STATE + WORK + INBOX + HISTORY"
    - "Ephemeral execution log pattern (WORK.md deleted after promotion)"
    - "Dual-source loop capture (user non-linear + agent discovery)"
    - "Moderate depth state for weak agent resume"

  modified: []

key-decisions:
  - "STATE.md has moderate depth with Key Decisions table to prevent agent re-asking"
  - "WORK.md is explicitly ephemeral and deleted after phase promotion"
  - "INBOX.md separates user loops from agent loops (two sources)"
  - "HISTORY.md maintains minimal one-line-per-phase format"

patterns-established:
  - "Template hierarchy: Phase > Session > Task"
  - "Cross-references: STATE.md → INBOX.md for open loops"
  - "Session log format for continuity tracking"

# Phase 01.2 Plan 02: Supporting Templates Summary

**Four template files (STATE, WORK, INBOX, HISTORY) creating the 5-file GSD-lite structure for single-agent session management**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-22T19:13:05Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-22T19:15:05Z
- **Tasks:** 4
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments
- Created STATE.md template with moderate depth including Key Decisions table for weak agent resume
- Created WORK.md template with ephemeral execution logging pattern
- Created INBOX.md template with dual-source loop capture (user + agent)
- Created HISTORY.md template with minimal completed phase tracking

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create STATE.md template with moderate depth** - `3ec4ec3` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create WORK.md template for verbose execution** - `c5de8a4` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Create INBOX.md template for loop capture** - `47da7d5` (feat)
4. **Task 4: Create HISTORY.md template for completed phases** - `94d6816` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `gsd_lite/STATE.md` - Phase/task/decision tracker with moderate depth for weak agent resume
- `gsd_lite/WORK.md` - Verbose execution log marked as ephemeral (deleted after promotion)
- `gsd_lite/INBOX.md` - Loop capture from both user (non-linear) and agent (discovery)
- `gsd_lite/HISTORY.md` - Minimal one-line-per-phase completed record

## Decisions Made

**STATE.md depth level:** Moderate depth with Key Decisions table so weak agent doesn't re-ask questions and can resume without reading full WORK.md

**WORK.md ephemeral marking:** Explicitly marked as ephemeral with deletion reminder to establish aggressive trim workflow pattern

**INBOX.md dual sources:** Separated "From User" and "From Agent" sections per CONTEXT.md requirement that loops originate from both non-linear user thinking AND agent discovery

**HISTORY.md minimal format:** One line per completed phase linking to external artifacts (PRs, docs) rather than duplicating details

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

Ready for Phase 01.2-03: All 4 supporting templates (STATE, WORK, INBOX, HISTORY) are now created and work together with PROTOCOL.md to form the complete 5-file structure. Next phase can consolidate redundant files (README, INIT_PROMPT, BOOTLOADER) now that the core structure is established.

No blockers. All templates follow the confirmed hierarchy (Phase > Session > Task) and cross-reference appropriately.
