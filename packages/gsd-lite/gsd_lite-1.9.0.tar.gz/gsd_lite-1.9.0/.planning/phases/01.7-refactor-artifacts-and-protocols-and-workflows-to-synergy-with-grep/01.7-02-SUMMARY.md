    provides: Research on grep-optimized artifacts and pair programming philosophy
provides:
  - All 5 workflow files updated with pair programming philosophy
  - First-turn protocol preventing artifact writes before conversation
  - Confirmation loops with [YOUR TURN] handoffs
  - STATE.md references replaced with WORK.md throughout
  - promotion.md deprecated in favor of housekeeping.md

  - "Deprecate promotion.md workflow (superseded by housekeeping.md)"

patterns-established:
  - "Thinking partner behaviors: propose hypotheses, challenge assumptions, teach with analogies, celebrate discoveries, transparent reasoning, validate first"
  - "First-turn protocol: Read artifacts silently, talk to user about understanding, only then write to artifacts"
  - "Confirmation loops: End substantive responses with [YOUR TURN] - explicit handoff to user"
  - "Frustration handling: Switch from Socratic questioning to direct explanation when user stuck, resume guided inquiry after confidence restored"

# Phase 01.7 Plan 02: Workflow Pair Programming Philosophy Summary

**Transformed 5 workflows from task executor to thinking partner with first-turn protocol, confirmation loops, and WORK.md migration**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 8 min (478 seconds)
- **Started:** 2026-01-27T15:57:14Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-27T16:05:12Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 6

## Accomplishments
- All 5 active workflow files updated with pair programming philosophy replacing hierarchical coaching
- First Turn Protocol added preventing artifact writes before user conversation on fresh sessions
- Confirmation loops with [YOUR TURN] added throughout all workflows for explicit handoffs
- All STATE.md references replaced with WORK.md (single artifact pattern)
- promotion.md deprecated with clear migration path to housekeeping.md

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Update moodboard and whiteboard** - `ca47ded` (refactor)
   - Pair programming philosophy
   - First Turn Protocol
   - Confirmation loops
   - STATE.md → WORK.md migration

2. **Task 2: Update execution and checkpoint** - `1945fa7` (refactor)
   - Pair programming philosophy with frustration handling
   - First Turn Protocol
   - Confirmation loops after tasks/blockers
   - STATE.md → WORK.md migration

3. **Task 3: Update revisit and deprecate promotion** - `537c54e` (refactor)
   - Pair programming philosophy emphasizing healthy rethinking
   - First Turn Protocol
   - Confirmation loops
   - promotion.md deprecation notice

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/gsd_lite/template/workflows/moodboard.md` - Added thinking partner coaching, first-turn protocol, [YOUR TURN] handoffs, WORK.md references
- `src/gsd_lite/template/workflows/whiteboard.md` - Same transformations as moodboard
- `src/gsd_lite/template/workflows/execution.md` - Added thinking partner coaching with frustration handling, first-turn protocol, [YOUR TURN] after tasks/blockers
- `src/gsd_lite/template/workflows/checkpoint.md` - Added thinking partner coaching, first-turn protocol, updated to use WORK.md Current Understanding
- `src/gsd_lite/template/workflows/revisit.md` - Added thinking partner coaching emphasizing healthy rethinking, first-turn protocol, [YOUR TURN] handoffs
- `src/gsd_lite/template/workflows/promotion.md` - Added deprecation notice pointing to housekeeping.md

## Decisions Made

1. **Pair programming philosophy over hierarchical**: Changed from "user owns outcome, agent executes" to "user + agent = thinking partners exploring together" to encourage collaborative discovery rather than command-and-control execution

2. **First Turn Protocol mandatory**: Required agents to read artifacts silently, talk to user about understanding, then write to artifacts - fixes bug where agents wrote to artifacts on first turn without user conversation

3. **Explicit confirmation loops**: Added [YOUR TURN] handoffs at end of substantive responses to create explicit back-and-forth rhythm, prevent agents from continuing without user input

4. **WORK.md replaces STATE.md**: Migrated all STATE.md references to WORK.md to consolidate session state and progress log into single artifact, simplifying context loading for fresh agents

5. **Frustration handling in execution**: Added guidance to switch from Socratic questioning to direct explanation when user stuck, then resume guided inquiry after confidence restored

6. **Deprecate promotion.md**: Marked promotion.md as deprecated in favor of housekeeping.md which provides more comprehensive phase completion workflow

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - workflow updates proceeded smoothly following the plan specifications.

## Next Phase Readiness

All workflow files now embody pair programming philosophy and first-turn protocol. Ready for:
- Phase 01.7-03: Update PROTOCOL.md and templates to reference WORK.md instead of STATE.md
- Testing workflows with fresh agents to validate first-turn protocol behavior
- User evaluation of thinking partner approach vs hierarchical coaching

Potential concerns:
- First-turn protocol adds verbal exchange before action - may feel slow initially, but prevents mis-aligned execution
- Confirmation loops increase back-and-forth - trade verbosity for explicit handoffs and user control
- WORK.md migration may require updating other artifacts (PROTOCOL.md, templates) for consistency
