# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 01.7-01
    provides: grep-optimized artifacts (WORK.md, PROTOCOL.md, INBOX.md, HISTORY.md)
  - phase: 01.7-02
    provides: pair programming workflows (moodboard, execution, housekeeping)
provides:
  - Comprehensive README explaining philosophy and design rationale
  - Grep workflow patterns for agents and power users
  - Session walkthrough with conversational examples
  - Maintainer's guide with semantic CICD principles
  - Core principles table (observable, testable, justified)
affects: [future-maintainers, documentation-updates, philosophy-changes]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "Semantic CICD: Core principles documented with observable/testable criteria"
    - "Conversational README: Show don't tell with real examples"

key-files:
  created: []
  modified:
    - README.md

key-decisions:
  - "Place README at repository root (not template dir) for immediate user visibility"
  - "Include conversational session walkthrough to demonstrate pair programming philosophy"
  - "Document core principles with testable criteria to prevent regression"
  - "Add maintainer's guide as semantic CICD for future iterations"

patterns-established:
  - "README philosophy section explains WHY (thinking partners, perpetual WORK.md, grep-first)"
  - "Grep workflow section provides patterns for efficient navigation"
  - "Core principles table makes design constraints observable and testable"

# Phase 01.7 Plan 03: README with Philosophy and Maintainer's Guide Summary

**Root README documenting pair programming philosophy, grep-first patterns, session walkthrough with conversational examples, and semantic CICD maintainer's guide**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-27T16:19:05Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-27T16:20:50Z
- **Tasks:** 3 (2 completed in previous checkpoint, 1 fix + Task 3 completed here)
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Created comprehensive README at repository root explaining philosophy and design
- Documented thinking partner approach with conversational examples
- Added grep workflow patterns for efficient navigation
- Added maintainer's guide with semantic CICD principles and core principles table

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create README with philosophy and artifact overview** - `0025a4b` (docs)
2. **Task 2: Add session walkthrough and workflow diagram** - `ba3caf8` (docs)
3. **Fix: Correct README location + Task 3: Add maintainer's guide** - `26ee136` (fix)

**Note:** Tasks 1-2 were completed in previous checkpoint but placed README in wrong location (template dir). Continuation fixed location and completed Task 3.

## Files Created/Modified
- `README.md` - Root README with philosophy, grep patterns, session walkthrough, workflow diagram, and maintainer's guide

## Decisions Made

**1. README location correction**
- Original checkpoint placed README at `src/gsd_lite/template/README.md` (wrong)
- User feedback: "the readme seems to be put in the wrong place. I meant we want to update the ROOT repo README"
- Fixed: Moved content to repository root `README.md` for immediate user visibility

**2. Conversational tone for examples**
- Session walkthrough uses realistic dialogue showing pair programming approach
- Examples demonstrate agent proposing hypotheses, explaining reasoning, using `[YOUR TURN]` handoffs
- Rationale: Show philosophy in action rather than just describing it

**3. Core principles with testable criteria**
- Each principle includes: observable artifacts, test command, rationale
- Example: "Pair programming > task execution" tested via `grep "thinking partner" workflows/` returns 5+ matches
- Rationale: Makes design constraints machine-verifiable to prevent regression

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] README location correction**
- **Found during:** User checkpoint feedback on Tasks 1-2
- **Issue:** README was created at `src/gsd_lite/template/README.md` instead of repository root
- **Fix:** Moved content to `/Users/luutuankiet/dev/gsd_lite/README.md` and removed template copy
- **Files modified:** README.md (root), src/gsd_lite/template/README.md (deleted)
- **Verification:** Root README exists with full content, template README removed
- **Committed in:** 26ee136 (combined with Task 3)

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (1 blocking - location correction)
**Impact on plan:** Location fix was essential for user visibility. Combined with Task 3 in single commit for efficiency.

## Issues Encountered

**Initial checkpoint confusion:**
- Tasks 1-2 interpreted "update README" as template README (user docs for agents)
- User clarified: root repository README (project docs for humans)
- Resolution: Fixed location and continued with Task 3

No technical issues during execution.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

**Ready for Plan 04:**
- README complete with philosophy and maintainer's guide
- Semantic CICD principles documented for future iterations
- Core principles table enables regression testing

**Documentation coverage:**
- Philosophy: Thinking partners, perpetual WORK.md, grep-first retrieval
- Practical guidance: Grep patterns, session walkthrough, workflow diagram
- Maintenance: Testing guidance, core principles, update guidelines

**No blockers.** All artifacts and workflows documented for users and maintainers.
