# Phase 1.5: Evaluation Framework for GSD-lite Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Build evaluation sequence in ./tests/eval_gsd_lite with simulated repo setup, step-by-step prompts, reference agent responses, and eval notes framework for iterative QC
**Verified:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Simulated ETL pipeline is runnable | ✓ VERIFIED | Pipeline runs successfully: `Pipeline Complete` |
| 2 | Test suite for simulation exists and passes | ✓ VERIFIED | 4/4 tests passed in `test_transform.py` |
| 3 | Evaluation instructions (Driver Manual) are complete | ✓ VERIFIED | `DRIVER_MANUAL.md` contains specific copy-paste prompts |
| 4 | Evaluation scoring template (Eval Log) is ready | ✓ VERIFIED | `EVAL_LOG.md` contains table and rubric |
