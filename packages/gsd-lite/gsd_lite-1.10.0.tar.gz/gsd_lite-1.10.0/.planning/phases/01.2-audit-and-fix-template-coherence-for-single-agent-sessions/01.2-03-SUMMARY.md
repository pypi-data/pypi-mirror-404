# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 01.2-01
    provides: PROTOCOL.md single entrypoint with file guide
  - phase: 01.2-02
    provides: Supporting templates (STATE, WORK, INBOX, HISTORY)
provides:
  - Clean 5-file gsd_lite/ structure with no redundant files
  - Protocol coherence fixes: systematic IDs, resume clarity, completion protocol
  - Sticky note format alignment with checkpoint emoji banners
affects: [01.3-create-gsd-lite-session-template, all-future-phases]

# Tech tracking

  patterns:
    - "Systematic ID format (TYPE-NNN) across all artifacts"
    - "User-controlled phase completion (agent signals readiness, user decides)"
    - "Checkpoint emoji banner protocol for sticky notes"
    - "Artifact update timing (after every turn, not occasionally)"

key-decisions:
  - "Systematic IDs required throughout all artifacts for quick lookup and greppability"
  - "Phase completion is user-controlled to prevent premature WORK.md trimming"
  - "Sticky note includes checkpoint emoji banners for blocking checkpoints"
  - "Artifact updates after EVERY turn (not occasionally) for consistency"

patterns-established:
  - "TYPE-NNN format: PHASE-NNN, TASK-NNN, LOOP-NNN, DECISION-NNN for unambiguous references"
  - "ID Registry in STATE.md tracks next available ID per type"
  - "Resume mid-task scenarios with concrete chat app examples"
  - "Phase lifecycle: Planning → Execution → User requests completion → Promotion"

# Phase 1.2 Plan 3: Cleanup and Verification Summary

**5-file gsd_lite/ structure finalized with protocol coherence fixes: systematic IDs, resume clarity, user-controlled completion, and sticky note alignment**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-23T02:48:44Z (user's first commit)
- **Completed:** 2026-01-23T02:48:44Z (user's final commit)
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 5

## Accomplishments
- Clean 5-file gsd_lite/ directory with no redundant files (PROTOCOL.md, STATE.md, WORK.md, INBOX.md, HISTORY.md)
- Protocol coherence fixes addressing 5 critical issues from human review
- Systematic ID format (TYPE-NNN) implemented across all artifacts
- User-controlled phase completion protocol preventing premature data loss
- Sticky note format aligned with checkpoint emoji banners and action menus

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Remove redundant files** - N/A (files were never tracked in git, cleanup completed)
2. **Task 2: Human verification** - APPROVED with additional fixes:
   - `1ef267a` - fix(01.2-03): address protocol coherence issues from human review
   - `2b50dcb` - fix(01.2-03): add checkpoint banner and action menu to sticky note protocol
   - `19542fa` - fix(01.2-03): add informational checkpoint emojis and confirmation format
   - `99bada5` - docs: minor changes to protocol

**Plan metadata:** (this commit)

## Files Created/Modified

All modifications made by user during verification:

- `gsd_lite/PROTOCOL.md` - Added systematic IDs, resume clarity, completion protocol, sticky note format, checkpoint emoji banners
- `gsd_lite/STATE.md` - Added ID Registry, systematic ID examples, updated all entries
- `gsd_lite/WORK.md` - Updated execution log format with systematic IDs
- `gsd_lite/INBOX.md` - Updated loop format with LOOP-NNN IDs
- `gsd_lite/HISTORY.md` - Updated phase format with PHASE-NNN IDs

## Decisions Made

**1. Systematic ID format (TYPE-NNN) required throughout**
- **Rationale:** Quick lookup, greppable, unambiguous references across all artifacts
- **Implementation:** PHASE-NNN, TASK-NNN, LOOP-NNN, DECISION-NNN with ID Registry in STATE.md
- **Impact:** All future sessions must use systematic IDs

**2. Phase completion is user-controlled**
- **Rationale:** Prevent premature WORK.md trimming (data loss) if agent signals ready but user wants to continue
- **Implementation:** Agent signals readiness → User decides when to promote → Promotion workflow executes
- **Impact:** User maintains control over phase lifecycle

**3. Artifact updates after EVERY turn**
- **Rationale:** Consistency and resume reliability (fixed "occasionally" vs "frequently" confusion)
- **Implementation:** STATE.md and WORK.md updated after every turn, marked as such in File Guide
- **Impact:** Agents must update artifacts consistently, no ambiguity

**4. Sticky note includes checkpoint emoji banners**
- **Rationale:** Visual clarity for blocking checkpoints, matches 01-02 spec
- **Implementation:** 6 informational checkpoint types with distinct emojis, plus action menu
- **Impact:** Sticky notes have consistent format with clear visual hierarchy

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

Task 1 (file cleanup) was already complete (redundant files were never tracked in git).
Task 2 (human verification) resulted in user making additional protocol improvements, which is expected behavior for verification checkpoints.

## Issues Encountered

None - plan executed smoothly. User identified protocol coherence issues during verification and addressed them with 4 systematic commits.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

**Ready for Phase 1.3 (Create GSD-lite Session Template):**
- 5-file structure finalized and verified
- Protocol coherence issues resolved
- Systematic ID format established
- Resume clarity improved with concrete examples
- User-controlled completion protocol documented

**No blockers.** Templates are now ready to be packaged into a session template for distribution.
