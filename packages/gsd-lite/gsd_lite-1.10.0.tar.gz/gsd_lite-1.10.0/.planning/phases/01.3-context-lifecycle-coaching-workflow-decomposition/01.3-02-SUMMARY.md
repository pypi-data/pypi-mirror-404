# Phase 01.3 Plan 02: Execution & Checkpoint Workflows Summary

**Two self-contained workflow files with context lifecycle documentation and identical sticky note protocol**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 4 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-25T08:29:11Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-25T08:33:23Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files created:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Created execution.md workflow (373 lines) with coaching philosophy, loop capture, and scope discipline
- Created checkpoint.md workflow (385 lines) with context lifecycle (checkpoint -> clear -> resume) pattern
- Documented context lifecycle with mermaid diagrams showing session transitions
- Established identical sticky note protocol across both workflows for consistency

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create execution.md workflow** - `d57aeb3` (feat)
   - Entry/exit conditions for execution mode
   - Coaching philosophy with governance framework
   - Journalist Rule for rich logging
   - Loop capture protocol (user + agent sources)
   - Scope discipline protocol
   - Checkpoint emoji banners (blocking + informational)
   - Sticky note protocol with gsd-status marker

2. **Task 2: Create checkpoint.md workflow** - `9e79f7d` (feat)
   - Entry/exit conditions for checkpoint mode
   - Context lifecycle documentation (checkpoint -> clear -> resume)
   - Mermaid diagrams for lifecycle and session hierarchy
   - Promotion workflow (extract, record, trim, clear)
   - User-controlled completion protocol
   - Sticky note protocol with gsd-status marker

## Files Created/Modified

- `gsd-lite/workflows/execution.md` - Task execution mode protocol with loop capture and scope discipline
- `gsd-lite/workflows/checkpoint.md` - Promotion/handoff mode protocol with context lifecycle pattern

## Decisions Made

**Context lifecycle pattern documented:**
- Checkpoint (end of session): STATE.md captures context, WORK.md trimmed after extraction
- Clear (between sessions): Fresh chat/context window, 0% token usage at start
- Resume (new session): Agent reads artifacts to reconstruct context, not chat history

**Sticky note protocol consistency:**
- Both workflows include identical sticky note section with gsd-status marker
- Self-check section prevents phantom updates (discovered in Gemini eval)
- Progress indicators show phase completion status

**User-controlled completion:**
- Agent signals readiness when all tasks complete
- User decides when to promote (prevents premature WORK.md trimming)
- Critical because promotion deletes WORK.md (material for PR descriptions lost if auto-promoted)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - straightforward extraction from PROTOCOL.md with research-informed additions.

## User Setup Required

None - documentation-only phase.

## Next Phase Readiness

**Ready for Plan 01.3-03:** Analysis workflow creation
- Execution and checkpoint workflows provide template structure
- Sticky note protocol established as canonical format
- Context lifecycle pattern documented for reference

**Ready for Plan 01.3-04:** PROTOCOL.md refactoring
- Both workflows demonstrate ~200-400 line target length
- Entry/exit conditions provide routing structure
- Workflow decomposition pattern proven

**Ready for Plan 01.3-05:** Sticky note verification
- Identical sticky note sections exist in execution.md (lines 274-358) and checkpoint.md (lines 266-350)
- Can be verified for byte-for-byte identity
- No blockers for consolidation
