<objective>
Verify workflow decomposition and cleanup.

Purpose: Final verification that all deliverables are complete, coherent, and working together. Human reviews the system to confirm understanding. Clean up any remaining issues.

Output: Verified, complete workflow system ready for use.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Verify sticky note consistency</name>
  <files>gsd-lite/workflows/*.md</files>
  <action>
Read all four workflow files and verify:

1. Each has a "Sticky Reminder" or "Sticky Note Protocol" section
2. The section content is IDENTICAL across all files (copy-paste check)
3. Each includes the gsd-status fenced block format
4. Each includes the self-check section

**Identity verification method:**
- Extract sticky note section from each workflow file
- Compare content character-by-character (diff shows no changes)
- If differences found: determine canonical version, copy to all 4 workflows

If inconsistencies found, fix them by copying the canonical sticky note section to all workflows.
  </action>
  <verify>
- All 4 workflow files contain sticky note section
- Sections are IDENTICAL (diff between files shows no changes in sticky note section)
- Self-check section present in all
  </verify>
  <done>
Sticky note sections verified/fixed to be identical across all workflows.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify no ASCII art remains</name>
  <files>gsd-lite/workflows/*.md, gsd-lite/PROTOCOL.md</files>
  <action>
Scan all workflow files and PROTOCOL.md for:

1. ASCII box drawings (+-+, |, etc.)
2. ASCII flow diagrams (-->, ==>, etc. outside of mermaid blocks)
3. ASCII tables without markdown format

Replace any found with:
- Mermaid diagrams (for flows)
- Markdown tables (for tabular data)
- Markdown headers (for structure)

Exception: Mermaid diagrams may use --> which is valid mermaid syntax.
  </action>
  <verify>
- No ASCII box drawings found
- All diagrams are mermaid or markdown
  </verify>
  <done>
All ASCII art replaced with markdown headers and mermaid diagrams.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Verify router completeness</name>
  <files>gsd-lite/PROTOCOL.md</files>
  <action>
Verify PROTOCOL.md router:

1. Contains workflow router table with all 4 modes
2. References correct workflow files
3. Contains file guide with write targets
4. Contains systematic ID format section
5. Contains golden rules
6. Contains coaching philosophy summary
7. Contains context lifecycle summary

If any section missing, add it from the template in 01.3-03-PLAN.md Task 1.
  </action>
  <verify>
- Router table present with 4 modes
- All sections present
- File is < 200 lines
  </verify>
  <done>
PROTOCOL.md router is complete and minimal.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Complete workflow decomposition system with 4 workflows, minimal router, and mode tracking</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Review the following files and confirm understanding:

1. **gsd-lite/PROTOCOL.md** - Minimal router (~100-150 lines)
   - Does it clearly explain which workflow to load based on mode?
   - Is it easy to understand?

2. **gsd-lite/workflows/moodboard.md** - Dream extraction
   - Does it explain the questioning approach?
   - Is the 10x emoji banner format clear?

3. **gsd-lite/workflows/whiteboard.md** - Plan proposal
   - Does it explain how to present scope?
   - Is the governance table clear?

4. **gsd-lite/workflows/execution.md** - Task work
   - Does it explain WORK.md logging?
   - Is scope discipline clear?

5. **gsd-lite/workflows/checkpoint.md** - Promotion
   - Does it explain context lifecycle?
   - Is the promotion workflow clear?

6. **gsd-lite/template/STATE.md** - Mode tracking
   - Does it include Current Mode field?

7. **eval/ANALYSIS.md** - Eval findings
   - Do the coaching violations make sense?
   - Are the architectural gaps clear?

<verification>
1. All 4 workflow files exist and are self-contained
2. PROTOCOL.md is minimal router (< 200 lines)
3. STATE.md template has mode tracking
4. Sticky notes identical across all workflows
5. No ASCII art (all mermaid/markdown)
6. Human confirms understanding
</verification>

<success_criteria>

  2. Coaching philosophy articulated (in each workflow)
  3. PROTOCOL.md decomposed into per-workflow files
  4. Sticky note in ALL workflows
  5. No ASCII art
  6. Eval findings analyzed (ANALYSIS.md)
  7. GSD-lite vs OG GSD documented (ANALYSIS.md)
