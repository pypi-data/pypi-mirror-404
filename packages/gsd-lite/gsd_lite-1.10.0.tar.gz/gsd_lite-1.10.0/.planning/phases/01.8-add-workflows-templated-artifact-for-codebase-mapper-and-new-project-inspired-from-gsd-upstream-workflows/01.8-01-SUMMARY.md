# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 01.7-refactor-artifacts-for-grep-synergy
    provides: Grep-friendly patterns and WORK.md perpetual lifecycle
provides:
  - ARCHITECTURE.md template for codebase mapping output
  - PROJECT.md template for project initialization output
  - Both templates generalized for any project type
  - Grep-friendly header structure for both templates
affects: [01.8-02-map-codebase-workflow, 01.8-03-new-project-workflow]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "Single-file merged architecture (not 7-file OG GSD structure)"
    - "Lightweight project template (no Validated/Active/Out of Scope lifecycle)"
    - "Template guidance text with inline examples"

key-files:
  created:
    - src/gsd_lite/template/ARCHITECTURE.md
    - src/gsd_lite/template/PROJECT.md
  modified: []

key-decisions:
  - "ARCHITECTURE.md merges 7 OG GSD files into single template"
  - "PROJECT.md drops heavy lifecycle tracking for lightweight structure"
  - "Templates generalized for any project type (not Docker-specific)"
  - "Success Criteria provides 5000ft view connecting WORK.md to overall intent"

patterns-established:
  - "Template format: Required sections + placeholder guidance + inline examples"
  - "Grep-friendly: Consistent level-2 headers (## )"
  - "Lightweight philosophy: 30-70 lines including guidance"

# Phase 01.8 Plan 01: Create Template Artifacts Summary

**Lightweight ARCHITECTURE.md and PROJECT.md templates with 4+5 sections respectively, generalized for any project type, grep-friendly headers**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1.5 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-31T17:54:16Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-31T17:55:38Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments
- Created ARCHITECTURE.md template with Project Structure, Tech Stack, Data Flow, Entry Points sections
- Created PROJECT.md template with What This Is, Core Value, Success Criteria, Context, Constraints sections
- Both templates include placeholder guidance and inline examples
- Templates work for any project type (web apps, CLI tools, dbt, Docker, monorepos)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create ARCHITECTURE.md template** - `0ca8fd7` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create PROJECT.md template** - `e9e4ad1` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/gsd_lite/template/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Codebase mapping output template (67 lines)
- `src/gsd_lite/template/PROJECT.md` - Project initialization output template (52 lines)

## Decisions Made

**ARCHITECTURE.md structure:**
- Merged 7 OG GSD files (concerns.md, conventions.md, integrations.md, testing.md, structure.md, stack.md, architecture.md) into single template
- 4 required sections: Project Structure Overview, Tech Stack, Data Flow, Entry Points
- Data Flow supports both Mermaid diagrams and text descriptions (agent chooses based on project complexity)
- Project Structure goes 2 levels deep (root + one level down)
- Tech Stack limited to 2-5 critical dependencies only

**PROJECT.md structure:**
- Dropped OG GSD Validated/Active/Out of Scope lifecycle (too heavy for GSD-lite)
- Dropped Key Decisions table (decisions log in WORK.md instead)
- 5 required sections: What This Is, Core Value, Success Criteria, Context, Constraints
- Success Criteria provides "5000ft view" connecting WORK.md detailed logs to overall project intent
- Core Value emphasizes "the ONE thing that must work"

**Template design principles:**
- Generalized for any project type (not Docker-specific like eval examples)
- Grep-friendly with consistent `## ` level-2 header structure
- Include placeholder guidance showing what to fill in
- Inline examples demonstrating good vs bad content
- Lightweight: 30-70 lines including guidance text

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

Ready for 01.8-02 (map-codebase workflow) and 01.8-03 (new-project workflow).

Templates are complete and ready to be populated by workflows. Both templates reference eval examples at `.planning/phases/01.8-.../evals/` which demonstrate quality output.

No blockers.
