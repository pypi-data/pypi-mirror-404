# GSD-Lite History

<!--
MINIMAL record of completed phases.
One line per phase with systematic ID - just enough to know what was done.
Details live in external artifacts (PRs, docs, etc.)
-->

## Completed Phases

<!--
All phases get systematic ID: PHASE-NNN
IDs are globally unique and never reused.
-->

| ID | Name | Completed | Outcome |
|----|------|-----------|---------|
| PHASE-001 | [Name] | YYYY-MM-DD | [One-line summary + link to artifact] |

## How to Use

When archiving a completed task (via housekeeping workflow):
1. Add one-line entry above with PHASE-NNN or Task ID
2. Link to external artifact (PR, doc, etc.)
3. Archived log entries moved from WORK.md to this file

### Example Entry

| ID | Name | Completed | Outcome |
|----|------|-----------|---------|
| PHASE-001 | Add User Authentication | 2026-01-22 | JWT-based auth with login/logout endpoints (PR #42) |
| PHASE-002 | Password Reset Flow | 2026-01-24 | Email-based password reset (PR #45) |
