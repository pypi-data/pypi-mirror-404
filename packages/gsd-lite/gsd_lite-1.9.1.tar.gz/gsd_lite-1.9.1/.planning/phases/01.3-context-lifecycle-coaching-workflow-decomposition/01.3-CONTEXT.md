# Phase 1.3: Context Lifecycle, Coaching Model & Workflow Decomposition - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Define GSD-lite's context control strategy (checkpoint → clear → resume), coaching philosophy (user owns outcome, agent guides), and decompose monolithic protocol into per-workflow files. This phase establishes architecture and documentation — not new features.

## Implementation Decisions

### Verbose Logging for Async Handoff
- WORK.md captures detailed journalism for both async agents AND human reviewers
- Log depth: Decision journal + investigation trace + code snippets
  - Decision journal: "Considered X, rejected because Y, chose Z"
  - Investigation trace: Step-by-step discovery (like PR investigation logs)
  - Include relevant code excerpts to support findings
- Structure: Flat (headers only, no collapsible `<details>` sections)
- Timing: **Checkpoint-batched** (not real-time)
  - Agent executes work → hits checkpoint → logs accumulated findings → continues
  - Reduces cognitive load for weaker models
  - Sticky note protocol triggers logging prompts at checkpoints

### Promotion Artifact Pattern
- Reference: `./pr_sample.md` shows target output quality
- Key sections: Executive summary, investigation log, changes table, validation
- Async agent can read WORK.md cold and generate promotion artifact without live context

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact checkpoint intervals (when to trigger logging prompt)
- How to structure logging prompts within sticky notes
- Whether to include lineage diagrams or keep text-only

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- "I want WORK.md to be comprehensive enough that another agent reading it cold can write a PR like the pr_sample.md example"
- Investigation logs should trace the discovery journey, not just state conclusions
- Code snippets should include file paths and context (like the PR sample's SQL excerpts)

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
