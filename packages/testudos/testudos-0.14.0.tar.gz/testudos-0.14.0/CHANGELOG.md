## [0.14.0] - 2026-01-30

### Added
- Custom PyPI index URL support for private package repositories (closes #42)
  - `--default-index`: Replace PyPI as the default package index
  - `--index`: Additional package index URLs (repeatable)
  - `--find-links`: Local/remote directories for packages
  - `--no-index`: Disable registry indexes, use only find-links
  - `--index-strategy`: Strategy for multiple indexes (first-index, unsafe-first-match, unsafe-best-match)
  - All options available via CLI and `[tool.testudos]` in pyproject.toml

## [0.13.0] - 2026-01-23

### Added
- Shell completion support via Typer's built-in completion (resolves #21)
  - `--install-completion`: Install completion for the current shell
  - `--show-completion`: Show completion script for the current shell
- Automated release workflow that creates git tags and GitHub releases on merge to main
  - Extracts version from pyproject.toml and creates tag if it doesn't exist
  - Triggers existing PyPI publish workflow
- `CLAUDE.md` project guide for AI assistants with architecture, conventions, and commands
- README status badges for CI, PyPI version, Python versions, and license (closes #28)

## [0.12.0] - 2026-01-23

### Added
- `--color` / `--no-color` CLI flags to control colored output (resolves #20)
  - `--color`: Force colored output even when not connected to a TTY
  - `--no-color`: Disable colored output (useful for CI, piping, or accessibility)
  - Default behavior (no flag): Auto-detect based on terminal capabilities
  - Note: Rich also respects `NO_COLOR` and `FORCE_COLOR` environment variables

## [0.11.1] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed
- Fixed dependency installation for subject projects when using `uv run --isolated`
  - Previously, when the test command (e.g., pytest) was not a direct dependency of the
    subject project, uv would use a globally installed tool that ran in a separate
    environment without access to the project's dependencies
  - Now uses `--with <test_command>` flag to ensure the test command runs in the same
    isolated environment as the project, with full access to all dependencies
  - Also adds `--with coverage` when coverage mode is enabled

### Added
- Comprehensive test suite for dependency installation verification
  (`tests/test_dependency_installation.py`)

## [0.11.0] - 2025-12-27

### Added
- Test timeout configuration to fail tests that exceed a specified duration (resolves #23)
- `--timeout` / `-t` CLI option to set timeout in seconds per Python version
- `--no-timeout` CLI flag to disable timeout (overrides config file setting)
- `timeout` configuration option in `[tool.testudos]` section of pyproject.toml
- Clear timeout error messages indicating which version timed out

## [0.10.0] - 2025-12-27

### Changed
 - Renamed project to testudos

- Version bump validation script (`scripts/check_version_bump.py`)
- CI job to enforce version bump and changelog updates on PRs

### Changed
- Migrated parallel execution to use only asyncio, removing ThreadPoolExecutor (resolves #19)
- `run_tests_parallel` replaced by `run_tests_parallel_async` in public API
- `runner.run()` now uses `asyncio.run()` internally for parallel execution

### Removed
- `run_tests_parallel` function (use `run_tests_parallel_async` instead)
- `concurrent.futures` dependency for parallel execution

### Fixed
- Type errors across codebase to satisfy strict mypy checks
