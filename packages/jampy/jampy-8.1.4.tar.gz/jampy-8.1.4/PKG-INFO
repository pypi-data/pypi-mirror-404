``JamPy`` is a Python implementation of the Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM)
formalism for the dynamical modelling of galaxies. 

This software can be used e.g. to measure the mass of supermassive black holes 
in galaxies, to infer their dark-matter content or to measure galaxy masses and
density profiles.

The method calculates all the first and second velocity moments, for both the
intrinsic and the projected kinematics, in spherical and axisymmetric geometry.

The JAM solution assuming a cylindrically-oriented velocity ellipsoid was introduced in 
`Cappellari (2008) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008MNRAS.390...71C>`_,
while the solution assuming a spherically-oriented velocity ellipsoid was introduced in 
`Cappellari (2020) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494.4819C>`_

jam.axi.proj
============

Purpose
-------
This procedure calculates a prediction for all the projected first or second
velocity moments for an anisotropic (three-integral) axisymmetric galaxy model.

Any of the three components of the first velocity moment or any of the six
components of the symmetric velocity dispersion tensor are supported.
These include the line-of-sight velocities and the components of the proper motion.

Two assumptions for the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid are supported:

- The cylindrically-aligned ``(R, z, phi)`` solution was presented in
  `Cappellari (2008) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008MNRAS.390...71C>`_

- The spherically-aligned ``(r, th, phi)`` solution was presented in

Parameters
----------
surf_lum: array_like with shape (n,)
    peak surface values of the `Multi-Gaussian Expansion
    <https://pypi.org/project/mgefit/>`_ (MGE) Gaussians describing the
    surface brightness of the tracer population for which the kinematics
    is derived.

    The units are arbitrary as they cancel out in the final results.

    EXAMPLE: when one obtains the kinematics from optical spectroscopy,
    surf_lum contains the galaxy optical surface brightness, which has
    typical units of ``Lsun/pc^2`` (solar luminosities per ``parsec^2``).
sigma_lum: array_like with shape (n,)
    dispersion (sigma) in arcseconds of the MGE Gaussians describing the
    distribution of the kinematic-tracer population.
qobs_lum: array_like with shape (n,)
    observed axial ratio (q') of the MGE Gaussians describing the
    distribution of the kinematic-tracer population.
surf_pot: array_like with shape (m,)
    peak value of the MGE Gaussians describing the galaxy total-mass
    surface density in units of ``Msun/pc^2`` (solar masses per ``parsec^2``).
    This is the MGE model from which the model gravitational potential is
    computed.

    EXAMPLE: with a self-consistent model, one has the same Gaussians
    for both the kinematic-tracer and the gravitational potential.
    This implies ``surf_pot = surf_lum``, ``sigma_pot = sigma_lum`` and
    ``qobs_pot = qobs_lum``. The global M/L of the model is fitted by the
    routine when passing the ``data`` and ``errors`` keywords with the
    observed kinematics.
sigma_pot: array_like with shape (m,)
    dispersion in arcseconds of the MGE Gaussians describing the galaxy
    total-mass surface density.
qobs_pot: array_like with shape (m,)
    observed axial ratio of the MGE Gaussians describing the galaxy
    total-mass surface density.
inc: float
    inclination in degrees between the line-of-sight and the galaxy symmetry
    axis (0 being face-on and 90 edge-on).
mbh: float
    Mass of a nuclear supermassive black hole in solar masses.

    IMPORTANT: The model predictions are computed assuming ``surf_pot``
    gives the total mass. In the self-consistent case, one has
    ``surf_pot = surf_lum`` and if requested (keyword ``ml``) the program
    can scale the output ``model`` to best fit the data. The scaling is
    equivalent to multiplying *both* ``surf_pot`` and ``mbh`` by a factor M/L.
    To avoid mistakes, the actual ``mbh`` used by the output model is
    printed on the screen.
distance: float
    the distance of the galaxy in ``Mpc``. When the distance is derived 
    from redshift one should use the angular diameter distance ``D_A`` here.
xbin: array_like with shape (p,)
    X coordinates in arcseconds of the bins (or pixels) at which one wants
    to compute the model predictions. The X-axis is assumed to coincide with
    the galaxy projected major axis. The galaxy center is at ``(0,0)``.
    
    In general the coordinates ``(xbin, ybin)`` have to be rotated to bring 
    the galaxy major axis on the X-axis, before calling ``jam.axi.proj``.

    When no PSF/pixel convolution is performed (``sigmapsf=0`` or
    ``pixsize=0``) there is a singularity at ``(0,0)`` which must be
    avoided by the user in the input coordinates.
ybin: array_like with shape (p,)
    Y coordinates in arcseconds of the bins (or pixels) at which one wants
    to compute the model predictions. The Y-axis is assumed to coincide with
    the projected galaxy symmetry axis.

Other Parameters
----------------
align: {'cyl', 'sph'}, optional.
    Assumed alignment for the velocity ellipsoid during the solution of
    the Jeans equations.

    - ``align='cyl'`` assumes a cylindrically-aligned velocity ellipsoid
      using the solution of `Cappellari (2008)`_

    - ``align='sph'`` assumes a spherically-aligned velocity ellipsoid
      using the solution of `Cappellari (2020)`_

analytic_los: bool, optional
    This is ``True`` (default) if the line-of-sight integral is performed
    analytically and ``False`` if it is done via numerical quadrature.

    An analytic integral is only possible with ``align='cyl'`` and only for
    the second velocity moments. For this reason, when comparing the two
    second-moment solutions with ``align='cyl'`` and ``align='sph'``, it
    may be preferable to set ``analytic_los=False`` to ensure that
    numerical interpolation error is exactly the same in both cases.

    When ``align='sph'``, or when the user requests a first velocity
    moment, this keyword is automatically set to ``False``.
beta: array_like with shape (n,) or (4,)
    Radial anisotropy of the individual kinematic-tracer MGE Gaussians
    (Default: ``beta=np.zeros(n)``)::

        beta = 1 - (sigma_th/sigma_r)^2  # with align='sph'
        beta = 1 - (sigma_z/sigma_R)^2   # with align='cyl'

    When ``logistic=True`` the procedure assumes::

        beta = [r_a, beta_0, beta_inf, alpha]

    and the anisotropy of the whole JAM model varies as a logistic
    function of the logarithmic spherical radius (with ``align='sph'``) or
    of the logarithmic distance from the equatorial plane (with ``align='cyl'``)::

        beta(r) = beta_0 + (beta_inf - beta_0)/[1 + (r_a/r)^alpha]    # with align='sph'
        beta(z) = beta_0 + (beta_inf - beta_0)/[1 + (z_a/|z|)^alpha]  # with align='cyl'

    Here ``beta_0`` represents the anisotropy at ``r = 0``, ``beta_inf`` is
    the anisotropy at ``r = inf`` and ``r_a`` is the anisotropy transition
    radius (in arcsec like ``sigma_lum``), with ``alpha`` controlling the
    sharpness of the transition. 
    In the special case ``beta_0 = 0, beta_inf = 1, alpha = 2`` the
    anisotropy variation reduces to the form by Osipkov & Merritt, but the
    extra parameters allow for much more realistic anisotropy profiles. See
    details and an application in `Simon, Cappellari & Hartke (2024)
    <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.527.2341S>`_.
data: array_like with shape (p,), optional
    observed first or second velocity moment used to fit the model.

    EXAMPLE: In the common case where one has only line-of-sight velocities
    the second moment is given by::

        Vrms = np.sqrt(velBin**2 + sigBin**2)

    at the coordinates positions given by the vectors ``xbin`` and ``ybin``.

    If ``data`` is set and ``ml`` is negative or ``None``, then the model
    is fitted to the data, otherwise, the adopted ``ml`` is used and just
    the ``chi**2`` is returned.
epsrel: float, optional
    Relative error requested for the numerical computation of the intrinsic
    moments (before line-of-sight quadrature). (Default: ``epsrel=1e-2``)
errors: array_like with shape (p,), optional
    1sigma uncertainty associated with the ``data`` measurements.

    EXAMPLE: In the case where the data are given by the
    ``Vrms = np.sqrt(velBin**2 + sigBin**2)``, from the error propagation::

        errors = np.sqrt((dVel*velBin)**2 + (dSig*sigBin)**2)/Vrms,

    where ``velBin`` and ``sigBin`` are the velocity and dispersion in each
    bin and ``dVel`` and ``dSig`` are the corresponding 1sigma uncertainties.
    (Default: constant ``errors = 0.05*np.median(data)``)
flux_obs: array_like with shape (p,), optional
    Optional mean surface brightness of each bin for plotting.
gamma: array_like with shape (n,)
    tangential anisotropy of the individual kinematic-tracer MGE Gaussians
    (Default: ``gamma=np.zeros(n)``)::

        gamma = 1 - (sigma_phi/sigma_r)^2  # with align='sph'
        gamma = 1 - (sigma_phi/sigma_R)^2  # with align='cyl'

    When ``logistic=True`` the procedure assumes::

        gamma = [r_a, gamma_0, gamma_inf, alpha]

    and the anisotropy of the whole JAM model varies as a logistic
    function of the logarithmic spherical radius (with ``align='sph'``) or
    of the logarithmic distance from the equatorial plane (with ``align='cyl'``)::

        gamma(r) = gamma_0 + (gamma_inf - gamma_0)/[1 + (r_a/r)^alpha]    # with align='sph'
        gamma(z) = gamma_0 + (gamma_inf - gamma_0)/[1 + (z_a/|z|)^alpha]  # with align='cyl'

    Here ``gamma_0`` represents the anisotropy at ``r = 0``, ``gamma_inf``
    is the anisotropy at ``r = inf`` and ``r_a`` is the anisotropy
    transition radius (in arcsec like ``sigma_lum``), with ``alpha``
    controlling the sharpness of the transition. In the special case
    ``gamma_0 = 0, gamma_inf = 1, alpha = 2`` the anisotropy variation
    reduces to the form by Osipkov & Merritt, but the extra parameters
    allow for much more realistic anisotropy profiles.

    IMPORTANT: ``gamma`` only affects the projected first velocity moments.
    The projected second moments are rigorously independent of ``gamma``.
goodbins: array_like with shape (p,)
    Boolean vector with values ``True`` for the bins/spaxels which have to
    be included in the fit (if requested) and in the ``chi**2`` calculation.
    (Default: fit all bins).
interp: bool, optional
    This keyword is for advanced use only! Set ``interp=False`` to force 
    no-interpolation on the sky plane. In this way ``out.vel`` and 
    ``out.vel2`` contain all the first and second velocity moments at the 
    input coordinates ``(xbin, ybin)``, without PSF convolution.
    By default ``interp=True`` and one should generally not change this.

    IMPORTANT: If ``sigmapsf=0`` or ``pixsize=0`` or ``interp=False`` then
    PSF convolution is not performed.

    This keyword is mainly useful for testing against analytic results or
    to compute all moments, including proper motions,  simultaneously.
kappa: float, optional
    Scaling factor for the first velocity moments.

    - If ``kappa=None`` (default): The model's first velocity moments are
      scaled so that the projected angular momentum of the model matches
      that of the data (see equation 52 of `Cappellari (2008)`_). The sign
      of ``kappa`` is chosen to best fit the observed velocity field.
    
    - If ``kappa`` is a float (e.g., ``kappa=1``): The model's first
      velocity moments are multiplied by this value. ``kappa=1`` means no
      scaling is applied.
      
logistic: bool, optional
    When ``logistic=True``, JAM interprets the anisotropy parameters
    ``beta`` and ``gamma`` as defining a 4-parameters logistic function.
    See the documentation of the anisotropy keywords for details.
    (Default ``logistic=False``)
ml: float, optional
    Mass-to-light ratio (M/L) to multiply the values given by ``surf_pot``.
    Setting this keyword is completely equivalent to multiplying the
    output ``model`` by ``np.sqrt(M/L)`` after the fit. This implies that
    the BH mass is also scaled and becomes ``mbh*ml``.

    If ``ml=None`` (default) the M/L is fitted from the data and the
    best-fitting M/L is returned in output. The BH mass of the model is
    also scaled and becomes ``mbh*ml``.
moment: {'x', 'y', 'z', 'xx', 'yy', 'zz', 'xy', 'xz', 'yz'}, optional
    String specifying the component of the velocity first or second moments
    requested by the user in output. All values ar in ``km/s``.

    - ``moment='x'`` gives the first moment ``<V_x'>`` of the proper motion
      in the direction orthogonal to the projected symmetry axis.

    - ``moment='y'`` gives the first moment ``<V_y'>`` of the proper motion
      in the direction parallel to the projected symmetry axis.

    - ``moment='z'`` gives the first moment ``Vlos = <V_z'>`` of the
      line-of-sight velocity.

    - ``moment='xx'`` gives ``sqrt<V_x'^2>`` of the component of the proper
      motion dispersion tensor in the direction orthogonal to the projected
      symmetry axis.

    - ``moment='yy'`` gives ``sqrt<V_y'^2>`` of the component of the proper
      motion dispersion tensor in the direction parallel to the projected
      symmetry axis.

    - ``moment='zz'`` (default) gives the usual line-of-sight
      ``Vrms = sqrt<V_z'^2>``.

    - ``moment='xy'`` gives the mixed component ``<V_x'V_y'>`` of the proper
      motion dispersion tensor.

    - ``moment='xz'`` gives the mixed component ``<V_x'V_z'>`` of the proper
      motion dispersion tensor.

    - ``moment='yz'`` gives the mixed component ``<V_y'V_z'>`` of the proper
      motion dispersion tensor.
nang: int, optional
    The number of linearly-spaced intervals in the eccentric anomaly at
    which the model is evaluated before interpolation and PSF convolution.
    (default: ``nang=10``)
nlos: int (optional)
    Number of values used for the numerical line-of-sight quadrature.
    (default ``nlos=1500``)
nodots: bool, optional
    Set to ``True`` to hide the dots indicating the centers of the bins in
    the linearly-interpolated two-dimensional map (default ``False``).
normpsf: array_like with shape (q,)
    fraction of the total PSF flux contained in the circular Gaussians
    describing the PSF of the kinematic observations.
    The PSF will be used for seeing convolution of the model kinematics.
    It has to be ``np.sum(normpsf) = 1``.
nrad: int, optional
    The number of logarithmically spaced radial positions at which the
    model is evaluated before interpolation and PSF convolution. One may
    want to increase this value if the model has to be evaluated over many
    orders of magnitude in radius (default: ``nrad=20``).
pixang: float, optional
    Angle between the observed spaxels and the galaxy major axis X.
    This angle only rotates the spaxels around their centers, *not* the
    whole coordinate system ``(xbin, ybin)``, which must be rotated
    independently by the user before calling ``jam.axi.proj``. 
    Using the keyword is generally unnecessary.
pixsize: float, optional
    Size in arcseconds of the (square) spatial elements at which the
    kinematics is obtained. This may correspond to the side of the spaxel
    or lenslets of an integral-field spectrograph. This size is used to
    compute the kernel for the seeing and aperture convolution.

    IMPORTANT: If ``sigmapsf=0`` or ``pixsize=0`` or ``interp=False`` then
    PSF convolution is not performed.
plot: bool
    When ``data is not None`` setting this keyword produces a plot with the
    data/model comparison at the end of the calculation.
quiet: bool
    Set this keyword to avoid printing values on the console.
rbh: float, optional
    This keyword is ignored unless ``align='cyl'`` and ``analytic_los=True``.
    In all other cases JAM assume a point-like central black hole.
    This scalar gives the sigma in arcsec of the Gaussian approximating the
    central black hole of mass MBH [See Section 3.1.2 of `Cappellari (2008)`_]
    The gravitational potential is indistinguishable from a point source
    for ``radii > 2*rbh``, so the default ``rbh=0.01`` arcsec is appropriate
    in most current situations.

    When using different units as input, e.g. pc instead of arcsec, one
    should check that ``rbh`` is not too many order of magnitude smaller
    than the spatial resolution of the data.
sigmapsf: array_like with shape (q,)
    dispersion in arcseconds of the circular Gaussians describing the PSF
    of the kinematic observations.

    IMPORTANT: If ``sigmapsf=0`` or ``pixsize=0`` or ``interp=False`` then
    PSF convolution is not performed.

    IMPORTANT: PSF convolution is done by creating a 2D image, with pixels
    size given by ``step=np.min(sigmapsf)/4``, and convolving it with the
    PSF + aperture. If the input radii are very large compared to ``step``,
    the 2D image may require a too large amount of memory. If this is the
    case one may compute the model predictions at small radii with a first
    call to ``jam.axi.proj`` with PSF convolution, and the model
    predictions at large radii with a second call to ``jam.axi.proj``
    without PSF convolution.
step: float, optional
    Spatial step for the model calculation and PSF convolution in arcsec.
    This value is automatically computed by default as
    ``step=np.min(sigmapsf)/4``. It is assumed that when ``sigmapsf`` is
    large, high-resolution calculations are not needed. In some cases,
    however, e.g. to accurately estimate the Vrms inside a large aperture,
    comparable with the PSF size, one may want to override the default
    value to force smaller spatial pixels using this keyword.
vmax: float, optional
    Maximum value of the ``data`` to plot.
vmin: float, optional
    Minimum value of the ``data`` to plot.

Returns
-------
Stored as attributes of the ``jam.axi.proj`` class.

.chi2: float
    Reduced ``chi**2``, namely per degree of freedom,  describing the 
    quality of the fit::

        d, m = (data/errors)[goodbins], (model/errors)[goodbins]
        chi2 = ((d - m)**2).sum()/goodbins.sum()

    When no data are given in input, this is returned as ``np.nan``.

    used to plot the isophotes of the kinematic-tracer on the model results.

    [defined by equation 52 of `Cappellari (2008)`_]
.ml: float

.model: array_like with shape (p,)

    Any of the six components of the symmetric proper motion dispersion
    tensor ``{'xx', 'yy', 'zz', 'xy', 'xz', 'yz'}``, or any of the three 
    first velocity moments ``{'x', 'y', 'z'}`` can be returned in output.
    The desired model output is selected using the ``moment`` keyword.
    See the ``moment`` documentation for details.
.vel: array_like with shape (3, p)
    This attribute generally contains an intermediate result of the
    calculation and should not be used. Instead, the output kinematic
    model predictions are contained in the ``.model`` attribute.

    However, for advanced use only, when setting ``interp=False`` and
    ``analytic_los=False``, this attribute contains the first velocity
    moments for all the x, y and z components, *not* PSF convolved, at the
    sky coordinates ``(xbin, ybin)``.
.vel2: array_like with shape (3, 3, p)
    This attribute generally contains an intermediate result of the
    calculation and should not be used. Instead, the output kinematic
    model predictions are contained in the ``.model`` attribute.

    However, for advanced use only, when setting ``interp=False`` and
    ``analytic_los=False``, this attribute contains the full 3x3 second
    velocity moment tensor, *not* PSF convolved, at the sky coordinates
    ``(xbin, ybin)``.

jam.axi.intr
============

Purpose
-------
This procedure calculates all the intrinsic first and second velocity
moments for an anisotropic axisymmetric galaxy model.

This program is useful e.g. to model the kinematics of galaxies
like our Milky Way, for which the intrinsic moments can be observed
directly, or to compute starting conditions for N-body numerical
simulations of galaxies.

Two assumptions for the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid are supported:

- The cylindrically-aligned ``(R, z, phi)`` solution was presented in
  `Cappellari (2008) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008MNRAS.390...71C>`_

- The spherically-aligned ``(r, th, phi)`` solution was presented in
  `Cappellari (2020) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494.4819C>`_

Calling Sequence
----------------
.. code-block:: python

    import jampy as jam

    out = jam.axi.intr(
             dens_lum, sigma_lum, qintr_lum, dens_pot, sigma_pot, qintr_pot,
             mbh, Rbin, zbin, align='cyl', beta=None, data=None, epsrel=1e-2,
             errors=None, gamma=None, goodbins=None, interp=True,
             logistic=False, ml=None, nang=10, nodots=False, nrad=20,
             plot=True, proj_cyl=False, quiet=False)

    # The meaning of the output is different depending on `align`
    sig2R, sig2z, sig2phi, v2phi = out.model  # with align='cyl'
    sig2r, sig2th, sig2phi, v2phi = out.model  # with align='sph'

    out.plot()   # Generate data/model comparison

Parameters
----------
dens_lum: array_like with shape (n,)
    vector containing the peak value of the MGE Gaussians describing
    the intrinsic density of the tracer population for which the kinematics
    is derived.
    The units are arbitrary as they cancel out in the final results.
    Typical units are e.g. ``Lsun/pc^3`` (solar luminosities per ``parsec^3``)
sigma_lum: array_like with shape (n,)
    vector containing the dispersion (sigma) in ``pc`` of the MGE
    Gaussians describing the galaxy kinematic-tracer population.
qintr_lum: array_like with shape (n,)
    vector containing the intrinsic axial ratio (q) of the MGE
    Gaussians describing the galaxy kinematic-tracer population.
surf_pot: array_like with shape (m,)
    vector containing the peak value of the MGE Gaussians
    describing the galaxy total-mass density in units of ``Msun/pc^3``
    (solar masses per ``parsec^3``). This is the MGE model from which the
    model gravitational potential is computed.
sigma_pot: array_like with shape (m,)
    vector containing the dispersion in ``pc`` of the MGE
    Gaussians describing the galaxy total-mass density.
qintr_pot: array_like with shape (m,)
    vector containing the intrinsic axial ratio of the MGE
    Gaussians describing the galaxy total-mass density.
mbh: float
    Mass of a nuclear supermassive black hole in solar masses.
Rbin: array_like with shape (p,)
    Vector with the ``R`` coordinates in ``pc`` of the bins (or pixels) at
    which one wants to compute the model predictions. This is the first
    cylindrical coordinate ``(R, z)`` with the galaxy center at ``(0,0)``.

    There is a singularity at ``(0, 0)`` which should be avoided by the user
    in the input coordinates.
zbin: array_like with shape (p,)
    Vector with the ``z`` coordinates in ``pc`` of the bins (or pixels) at
    which one wants to compute the model predictions. This is the second
    cylindrical coordinate ``(R, z)``, with the z-axis coincident with the
    galaxy symmetry axis.

Other Parameters
----------------
align: {'cyl', 'sph'} optional
    If ``align='cyl'`` the program computes the solution of the Jeans
    equations with cylindrically-aligned velocity ellipsoid, presented
    in `Cappellari (2008)`_. If ``align='sph'`` the spherically-aligned
    solution of `Cappellari (2020)`_ is returned.
beta: array_like with shape (n,) or (4,)
    Vector with the axial anisotropy of the individual kinematic-tracer
    MGE Gaussians (Default: ``beta=np.zeros(n)``)::

        beta = 1 - (sigma_th/sigma_r)^2  # with align='sph'
        beta = 1 - (sigma_z/sigma_R)^2   # with align='cyl'

    When ``logistic=True`` the procedure assumes::

        beta = [r_a, beta_0, beta_inf, alpha]

    and the anisotropy of the whole JAM model varies as a logistic
    function of the logarithmic spherical radius (with ``align='sph'``) or
    of the logarithmic distance from the equatorial plane (with ``align='cyl'``)::

        beta(r) = beta_0 + (beta_inf - beta_0)/[1 + (r_a/r)^alpha]    # with align='sph'
        beta(z) = beta_0 + (beta_inf - beta_0)/[1 + (z_a/|z|)^alpha]  # with align='cyl'

    Here ``beta_0`` represents the anisotropy at ``r = 0``, ``beta_inf`` is
    the anisotropy at ``r = inf`` and ``r_a`` is the anisotropy transition
    radius (in arcsec like ``sigma_lum``), with ``alpha`` controlling the
    sharpness of the transition. 
    In the special case ``beta_0 = 0, beta_inf = 1, alpha = 2`` the
    anisotropy variation reduces to the form by Osipkov & Merritt, but the
    extra parameters allow for much more realistic anisotropy profiles. See
    details and an application in `Simon, Cappellari & Hartke (2024)
    <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.527.2341S>`_.
data: array_like of shape (4, p), optional
    Four input vectors with the observed values of:

    - ``[sigR, sigz, sigphi, vrms_phi]`` in ``km/s``, when ``align='cyl'``
      (or ``align='sph'`` and ``proj_cyl=True``).

      ``vrms_phi`` is the square root of the velocity second moment in the
      tangential direction. If the velocities ``vphi_j`` are measured from
      individual stars then ``vrms_phi = sqrt(mean(vphi_j^2))``.
      One can also use the relation ``vrms_phi = sqrt(vphi^2 + sigphi^2)``,
      where ``vphi = mean(vphi_j)`` and ``sigphi = std(vphi_j)``

    - ``[sigr, sigth, sigphi, vrms_phi]`` in ``km/s``, when ``align='sph'``,
      where ``vrms_phi`` is defined above.

epsrel: float, optional
    Relative error requested for the numerical quadratures, before
    interpolation (Default: ``epsrel=1e-2``).
errors: array_like of shape (4, p), optional
    ``1sigma`` uncertainties on ``data``, in the same format (default 5 ``km/s``).
gamma: array_like with shape (n,)
    Vector with the tangential anisotropy of the individual kinematic-tracer
    MGE Gaussians (Default: ``gamma=np.zeros(n)``)::

        gamma = 1 - (sigma_phi/sigma_r)^2  # with align='sph'
        gamma = 1 - (sigma_phi/sigma_R)^2  # with align='cyl'

    When ``logistic=True`` the procedure assumes::

        gamma = [r_a, gamma_0, gamma_inf, alpha]

    and the anisotropy of the whole JAM model varies as a logistic
    function of the logarithmic spherical radius (with ``align='sph'``) or
    of the logarithmic distance from the equatorial plane (with ``align='cyl'``)::

        gamma(r) = gamma_0 + (gamma_inf - gamma_0)/[1 + (r_a/r)^alpha]    # with align='sph'
        gamma(z) = gamma_0 + (gamma_inf - gamma_0)/[1 + (z_a/|z|)^alpha]  # with align='cyl'

    Here ``gamma_0`` represents the anisotropy at ``r = 0``, ``gamma_inf``
    is the anisotropy at ``r = inf`` and ``r_a`` is the anisotropy
    transition radius (in arcsec like ``sigma_lum``), with ``alpha``
    controlling the sharpness of the transition. In the special case
    ``gamma_0 = 0, gamma_inf = 1, alpha = 2`` the anisotropy variation
    reduces to the form by Osipkov & Merritt, but the extra parameters
    allow for much more realistic anisotropy profiles.

    IMPORTANT: ``gamma`` only affects the projected first velocity moments.
    The projected second moments are rigorously independent of ``gamma``.
goodbins: array_like with shape (4, p), optional
    Boolean vector of the same shape as ``data`` with values ``True``
    for the bins which have to be included in the fit (if requested) and
    ``chi^2`` calculation (Default: fit all bins).
interp: bool, optional
    If ``interp=False`` no interpolation is performed and the model is
    computed at every set of input (R, z) coordinates.
    If ``interp=True`` (default), the model is interpolated if the number
    of requested input (R, z) coordinates is larger than ``nang*nrad``.
logistic: bool, optional
    When ``logistic=True``, JAM interprets the anisotropy parameters
    ``beta`` and ``gamma`` as defining a 4-parameters logistic function.
    See the documentation of the anisotropy keywords for details.
    (Default ``logistic=False``)
ml: float, optional
    Mass-to-light ratio M/L. If ``ml=None`` (default) the M/L is fitted to
    the data and the best-fitting value is returned in output.
    The ``mbh`` is also scaled and becomes ``mbh*ml``.
    If ``ml=1`` no scaling is applied to the model.
nang: int, optional
    The number of linearly-spaced intervals in the eccentric anomaly at
    which the model is evaluated before interpolation (default: ``nang=10``).
nodots: bool, optional
    Set to ``True`` to hide the dots indicating the centers of the bins in
    the two-dimensional map (default ``False``).
nrad: int, optional
    The number of logarithmically spaced radial positions at which the
    model is evaluated before interpolation. One may want to increase this
    value if the model has to be evaluated over many orders of magnitude in
    radius (default: ``nrad=20``).
plot: bool, optional
    If ``plot=True`` (default) and ``data is not None``, produce a plot of
    the data-model comparison at the end of the calculation.
proj_cyl: bool, optional
    If ``align='sph'`` and ``proj_cyl=True``, the function projects the
    spherically-aligned moments to cylindrical coordinates and returns the
    ``[sig2R, sig2z, sig2phi, v2phi]`` components as in the case
    ``align='cyl'``. This is useful for a direct comparison of results with
    either the spherical or cylindrical alignment, as it allows one to fit
    the same data with both modelling assumptions.
quiet: bool, optional
    If ``quiet=False`` (default), print the best-fitting M/L and chi2 at
    the end for the calculation.

Returns
-------
Returned as attributes of the ``jam.axi.intr`` class.

.chi2: float
    Reduced chi^2 (chi^2/DOF) describing the quality of the fit::

        d = (data/errors)[goodbins]
        m = (model/errors)[goodbins]
        chi2 = ((d - m)**2).sum()/goodbins.sum()

.flux: array_like  with shape (p,)
    Vector with the MGE luminosity density at each ``(R, z)`` location in
    ``Lsun/pc^3``, used to plot the isophotes on the model results.
.ml: float
    Best fitting M/L. This value is fitted while ignoring ``sigphi`` and it
    is strictly independent of the adopted tangential anisotropy ``gamma``.
.model: array_like with shape (4, p)
    - Contains ``[sig2R, sig2z, sig2phi, v2phi]`` with ``align='cyl'``

    - Contains ``[sig2r, sig2th, sig2phi, v2phi]`` with ``align='sph'``

    where the above quantities are defined as follows:

    sig2R (sig2r): array_like with shape (p,)
        squared intrinsic dispersion in ``(km/s)^2`` along the R (r)
        direction at each ``(R, z)`` location.

    sig2z (sig2th): array_like with shape (p,)
        squared intrinsic dispersion in ``(km/s)^2`` along the z (th)
        direction at each ``(R, z)`` location.

    sig2phi: array_like with shape (p,)
        squared intrinsic dispersion in ``(km/s)^2``  along the
        tangential ``phi`` direction at each ``(R, z)`` location.

    v2phi: array_like with shape (p,)
        the second velocity moment in ``(km/s)^2`` along the
        tangential ``phi`` direction at each ``(R, z)`` location.

    The mean velocity along the tangential direction can be computed as
    ``vphi = np.sqrt(v2phi - sig2phi)``

    NOTE: I return squared velocities instead of taking the square root,
    to allow for negative values (unphysical solutions).

- Breaking changes to the overall package interface. However, the necessary
  modifications can be easily made using search and replace. There are no
  changes to the internal code. The new interface enhances discoverability and
  autocompletion of functions in current Python editors, and it simplifies
  imports. Previous calls like:

    out = jam.mge.vcirc(...)


V7.2.6: MC, Oxford, 04 August 2024
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``quad1d``: Replaced ``np.Inf`` with ``np.inf`` for compatibility with the
  latest NumPy 2.0.

V7.2.5: MC, Oxford, 20 May 2024
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``quad1d`` and ``quad2d``: Require positive values for either ``epsrel`` or
  ``epsabs`` keywords. Thanks to Carlos Melo (cufrgs.br) for the feedback.
- ``jam_axi_proj``: Dropped support for Python 3.9.

V7.2.4: MC, Oxford, 10 January 2024
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``jam_axi_proj``: Support prolate models with ``qobs_lum > 1`` or 
  ``qobs_pot > 1``.
- ``jam_axi_proj``: Output unconvolved surface brightness ``jam.flux`` when no
  PSF/aperture convolution is applied to the kinematics, due to zero
  ``sigmapsf`` or ``pixsize``.
- ``mge_vcirc``: Use scale-independent integration ranges like other JamPy
  functions.
- ``jam_axi_sersic``: Include ``sigma_e`` in the output and enable rotated
  aperture option. Updated docstring.

V7.2.1: MC, Oxford, 21 July 2023
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``jam_axi_intr``: Integrate all velocity components at the same time with a
  single call to the updated ``quad1d`` and ``quad2d``. Significant speedup.
- ``quad1d``, ``quad2d``: Allow for integration of vector functions. All
  components are integrated over the same set of evaluation points.
- ``jam_axi_proj``: Updated verbose output with more information.
- New procedure ``jam_axi_sersic`` to efficiently compute dynamical masses of
  axisymmetric galaxies described by Sersic profiles while allowing for seeing
  and aperture effects and assuming a given intrinsic axial ratio. This is
  meant to be a simple and quick replacement for the similar but less accurate
  virial estimators.
- New utility function ``cosmology_distance`` used in examples.

V7.1.0: MC, Oxford, 5 June 2023
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Separated computation for the black hole kinematics for both the
  cylindrically and spherically-aligned solutions. In both cases, this removed
  one numerical quadrature. This is useful in extreme situations when the
  minimum radius one wants to model around the black hole is orders of
  magnitude smaller than the smallest MGE Gaussian. This change eliminated the
  need for the ``rbh`` keyword in ``jam_axi_intr``, which I removed. The only
  case where the black hole is still approximated with a small Gaussian is in
  ``jam_axi_proj`` when both ``align='cyl'`` and ``analytic_los=True``.
- Adopted minimum radius based on ``step`` for the intrinsic interpolation grid
  as already done for the projected one.
- Simplified minimum-inclination test.
- Removed ``legacy`` folder with old redundant procedures.
- Moved the formalism for the LOS analytic integrand with ``align='cyl'`` into
  ``jam_axi_proj``.
- ``jam_axi_proj``, ``jam_axi_intr``, ``jam_sph_proj``, ``jam_sph_intr``: New
  keyword ``logistic`` to specify when JAM should interpret the input
  anisotropy parameters ``beta`` and ``gamma`` as defining a logistic function
  anisotropy profile.
- ``jam_axi_intr``: Use DE quadrature from ``[z, inf]`` instead of ``[0, 1]``
  with ``align='cyl'`` as already done with ``align='sph'``.
- ``jam_sph_proj``: Return convolved surface brightness.
- ``jam_hernquist_model_example``: New test against Osipkov-Merritt radial
  variation of the anisotropy using ``logistic=True``. Revised plot.

V7.0.10: MC, Oxford, 17 January 2023
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Introduced an analytic radial variation of the anisotropy ``beta``
  and ``gamma`` using a flexible logistic function of logarithmic radius
  ``beta(r) = beta_0 + (beta_inf - beta_0)/[1 + (r_a/r)^alpha]``.
  This function specifies the inner/outer anisotropy ``beta_0`` and
  ``beta_inf``, the anisotropy radius ``r_a`` and the sharpness ``alpha``
  of the transition. This new function is an alternative to assigning
  different anisotropies to different Gaussians. All procedures
  ``jam_axi_proj``, ``jam_axi_intr``, ``jam_sph_proj`` and ``jam_sph_intr``,
  with both ``align='sph'`` and ``align='cyl'``, were modified, documented
  and extensively tested to support the variable-anisotropy function.
- ``jam_sph_proj_example``: adapted to show the usage of the new analytic
  radial anisotropy variation.
- ``jam_axi_intr``: Fixed program stop in the plotting function.
- ``jam_axi_proj``: Raise an error when ``rbh`` is too small.
- ``jam_axi_proj``: Raise an error if the user includes the singularity
  ``(x,y) = (0,0)`` in the input coordinates without PSF convolution.
- ``quad1d``: new defaults ``singular=0`` and ``epsabs=0`` like ``quad2d``.

V6.4.0: MC, Oxford, 3 October 2022
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``jam_sph_proj``: Created this new function by renaming the procedure
  ``legacy.jam_sph_rms`` and changing its interface to be consistent with
  the axisymmetric version.
- ``jam_sph_proj``: Included special isotropic formula for testing.
- ``jam_sph_proj``: Included Osipkov-Merritt anisotropy for testing.
- ``jam_sph_proj``: Made quadrature limits insensitive to scaling.
- ``jam_sph_proj``: Simplified integrand with formulas of Cappellari (2020)
  and using recurrence relations to reduce calls to special functions.
- ``jam_sph_proj``: More efficient TANH transformation of the integration
  variable following Cappellari (2020).
- ``jam_sph_intr``: New function to compute the intrinsic moments in
  spherical symmetry.
- ``jam_axi_proj``: Removed fixed minimum radius limit in pc for the
  interpolation without PSF convolution. This avoids the risk of artificial 
  truncation when using small arbitrary spatial coordinates for testing.
- ``jam_axi_proj``: Tenfold increase of LOS evaluations to ``nlos=1500``.
- New procedure ``examples.jam_dark_halo_bayes_example.py``.
- Renamed ``quadva`` as ``quad1d`` with modified interface and new
  ``singular`` keyword to skip transforming the integration variable.

V6.3.3: MC, Oxford, 7 July 2021
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``jam_axi_proj``: Clarified meaning of ``interp`` keyword in docstring.     
  Thanks to Kai Zhu (nao.cas.cn) for the feedback.
- ``jam_axi_proj``: print "No PSF/pixel convolution" when ``interp == False``.

V6.3.2: MC, Oxford, 28 April 2021
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Use the new ``jam_axi_proj`` instead of ``legacy`` software in the examples.
- Removed redundant ``legacy`` examples. 

V6.3.1: MC, Oxford, 11 November 2020
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``jam_axi_proj``: New keyword ``analytic_los`` to chose between numeric
  or analytic line-of-sight integral for the second velocity moment,
  when ``align='cyl'``.
- ``jam_axi_proj``: Increased default value of ``nlos`` keyword.
- ``jam_axi_proj``: Raise an error if ``rbh`` is too small.

V6.2.1: MC, Oxford, 15 September 2020
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``jam_axi_proj``: Fixed program stop when ``data == ml == None``.
  Thank to Bitao Wang (pku.edu.cn) for reporting.

V6.2.0: MC, Oxford, 17 August 2020
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``jam_axi_proj``: Avoid possible division by zero after convolution,
  when the tracer MGE is much smaller than the field of view.
- ``jam_axi_proj``: Fully broadcasted ``vmom_proj``.
- ``jam_axi_proj``: Removed minimum-radius clipping in ``vmom_proj``.
- ``jam_axi_proj``: New ``interp`` keyword to force no-interpolation
  when using the full first and second velocity moments simultaneously.

V6.1.2: MC, Oxford, 20 June 2020
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``jam_axi_proj``: Fixed input ``ml`` being ignored. Thanks to Sabine
  Thater (univie.ac.at) and Takafumi Tsukui (grad.nao.ac.jp) for reporting.
- ``jam_axi_rms``: I reduced the interpolation error before the PSF
  convolution for all the routines in the ``legacy`` sub-folder, as already
  implemented in the new ``jam_axi_proj``. Thanks to Takafumi Tsukui
  (grad.nao.ac.jp) for reporting differences.
- ``jam_axi_intr``: Request input ``data = [sigR, sigz, sigphi, vrms_phi]``
  instead of ``data = [sigR, sigz, sigphi, vphi]``.
- ``jam_axi_intr``: exclude ``sigphi`` from ``ml`` fitting. These two
  changes make the fitted ``ml`` strictly independent of the adopted
  tangential anisotropy ``gamma``.

V6.0.1: MC, Oxford, 23 April 2020

  now provide either the intrinsic or the projected moments,
  respectively, for both the spherically-aligned and 
  cylindrically-aligned JAM solutions.
- I moved the previous procedures ``jam_axi_rms``, ``jam_axi_vel``
  and ``jam_sph_rms`` to the ``jampy.legacy`` folder.
