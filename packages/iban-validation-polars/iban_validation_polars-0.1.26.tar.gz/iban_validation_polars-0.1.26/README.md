# IBAN Validation for Polars (iban_validation_polars)
A high-performance Polars plugin for validating IBANs (International Bank Account Numbers) and extracting bank/branch identifiers leveraging Polars Multi-threaded feature and performance.

## Quick Start
Example:
```python
import polars as pl
from iban_validation_polars import process_ibans
import os

inputfile = r'iban_validation_rs/data/IBAN Examples.txt'
outputfile = r'iban_validation_polars/examples/test_file.csv'

# File generation 
df = pl.read_csv(inputfile).sample(10000000, with_replacement=True)
df.write_csv(outputfile)
print('writing to file complete')

# using the library
df = pl.scan_csv(outputfile)\
    .with_columns(
    validated=process_ibans('IBAN Examples').str.split_exact(',',2)\
        .struct.rename_fields(['valid_ibans', 'bank_id', 'branch_id'])
).unnest('validated').sort(by='IBAN Examples', descending=True)

# show some results
print(df.collect(streaming=True))

# cleanup
os.remove(outputfile)
```
## Features
✅ Fast IBAN validation (Rust-powered)

✅ Bank identifier extraction

✅ Branch identifier extraction

✅ Support for all IBAN countries (SWIFT Registry v99)

✅ Zero-copy operations where possible

## Installation
```bash 
pip install iban-validation-polars
```

## Performance Benchmarks
This polars plugin was the principal objective of this library; the benchmarks [here](../iban_validation_bench_py/README.md) highlight how much faster it is to use the plugin than to call the Python library with ```map_element``` (about 100 times faster).

## API Reference
`process_ibans(column: pl.Expr) -> pl.Expr`
Validates IBANs and extracts bank/branch information in a single operation.
Parameters:
 - column: A Polars expression containing IBAN strings in electronic format (no spaces)
    Electronic format only: No spaces or special characters.
    Case insensitive: Both uppercase and lowercase accepted when the IBAN definition allows it.
    Length: 15-34 characters depending on country, as per the registry definition.

Returns:

 - pl.Expr: A struct expression containing:
    - validated_iban (str): The valid IBAN if validation passes, empty string if invalid
    - bank_code (str): Bank identifier code (when relevant and valid) otherwise empty
    - branch_code (str): Branch identifier code (when relevant and valid) otherwise empty

## Common Use cases
 - Data Cleaning pipeline
 - Data validation report
 - Extracting valid IBANs only (filter for non-empty valid IBANs)

## Error Handling
This pluging does not raise exception under normal operation.
