# Iban Validation rs
Facilitate validation of ibans and getting the bank identifier and branch identifier in Rust.

See documentation for implementation details and a short example.

## Design Goals

This project is designed as a **validation engine**, not a user-facing IBAN formatting or parsing library.

The primary goals are:

- **Fast validation** of IBANs using a single pass over the input
- **Zero or minimal allocation** during validation
- **Deterministic performance** with explicit input limits
- **Accurate, country-specific structure validation** based on the official IBAN registry
- **Low dependency footprint** to ease integration in larger systems and FFI contexts

These goals intentionally favor backend and batch-processing use cases over convenience-oriented APIs.

## Validation Modes

The library provides **two distinct validation paths**, each with different trade-offs:

### Electronic (Strict) IBAN Validation

This mode expects an IBAN in *electronic format* (no spaces, no separators).

Characteristics:
- Known length upfront
- Early rejection on incorrect length
- Tight inner loop with minimal branching
- Highest possible performance

This mode is recommended for:
- Backend systems
- Batch validation
- Data pipelines
- Situations where the IBAN is already normalized

### Print / User-Friendly IBAN Validation

This mode accepts IBANs in *print format*, where spaces may appear between characters.

Characteristics:
- Streaming validation with space filtering
- Single-pass processing without allocation
- Explicit input length limits for safety
- Slightly lower performance due to mandatory per-byte inspection

Because spaces must be inspected and skipped, this mode is **inherently slower** than strict validation. This cost is fundamental and not an implementation artifact.

This mode is intended for:
- Ingesting user-provided data
- Transitional systems where normalization is not guaranteed


## Use Cases
The package is **not a general-purpose IBAN parsing or formatting library**. It is intentionally **not user-facing** and is designed primarily for backend systems.
Further, both the input and output of the library are intended to be in the 'electronic' format. BBAN (Basic Bank Account Number) validation only validates that the length, the position of the bank identifier, and the branch identifiers are correct. Further country-specific validations are not performed. 

BBAN (Basic Bank Account Number) validation only verifies length and the positions of bank and branch identifiers. Country-specific BBAN semantic checks are intentionally out of scope.

In contrast, IBAN validation aims to be:
- fast
- correct
- allocation-free where possible
- based on official registry data

The input is read only once, and validation is performed without constructing intermediate normalized strings unless explicitly required by the caller.

In contrast, the intention is to provide a quick, correct validation of the IBAN. Ideally, using minimal memory and CPU and reading the input only once. To integrate easily with other packages, it aims to keep dependencies low. A Python script pre-processed data for the library to decouple the main library and limit code change when a new version of the IBAN registry is released.

## Performance Philosophy

This project treats performance characteristics as part of the public contract.

In particular:
- Validation time is proportional to the number of bytes inspected
- Input normalization (such as space removal) is avoided where possible
- When normalization is required, its cost is explicit and documented
- Benchmarks are included to detect performance regressions over time

As a result, the library may appear lower-level than typical IBAN validation utilities, but it provides predictable behavior suitable for high-throughput systems.
