def topological_sort(events: List[Event]) -> List[Event]:
    """Sort events by causation relationships (parent before child).

    Uses Kahn's algorithm to perform topological sort. Events with no parent
    (causation_id = None) come first, followed by their descendants.

    Args:
        events: List of events to sort

    Returns:
        List of events in topological order (parents before children)

    Raises:
        CyclicDependencyError: If events form a cycle in causation graph

    Example:
        >>> e1 = Event(event_id="ID1", causation_id=None, ...)  # Root
        >>> e2 = Event(event_id="ID2", causation_id="ID1", ...)  # Child of e1
