# PROJECT.md Rules

> How we document the project for new team members.

## Purpose

PROJECT.md is the "senior engineer explaining the codebase over coffee" document.
It captures the ESSENCE of the project - not a comprehensive list, but the key
mental models someone needs to work here effectively.

## Document Structure

1. **What This Is** - 2-3 sentences capturing the essence (not a feature list)
2. **The Main Idea** - Core mental model in 1-2 paragraphs
3. **How It Works** - Narrative walkthrough + simple mermaid diagram
4. **Where The Action Is** - Hot spots and active areas where the team focuses
5. **What's Happening Now** - Current focus based on open/merged PRs
6. **The Key Players** - 3-5 most important things explained in context
7. **Before You Start Coding** - The "aha" moments and gotchas

## Writing Style

- Write like talking to a teammate, not writing documentation
- Use "we" and "you" language
- Explain WHY things are the way they are
- NO comprehensive lists - only what matters
- Paragraphs that flow, not bullet points
- Specific file paths in context, not in tables

## What to Explore First

Before writing PROJECT.md:
- Use get_area_importance with sort='focus' to find hot spots (current development focus)
- Use get_area_importance with sort='importance' for overall activity
- Look at open PRs to see current work in progress
- Look at recent merged PRs to see what shipped
- Use get_top_pagerank to find technically central pieces

## How to Use Data

DON'T dump metrics. Use them to INFORM writing:

- Instead of "65 commits, 17 authors" → "The team spends most time here because..."
- Instead of listing areas → "Recent work concentrates in three places..."
- Instead of "high PageRank" → "Everything flows through X because..."
- Hot spots tell you WHERE attention is; explain WHY it matters

## Example Format

```markdown
# Project Name

## What This Is
2-3 sentences capturing the essence. Not a feature list - what IS this thing?

## The Main Idea
The core mental model. What's the central concept everything revolves around?

## How It Works
Narrative walkthrough of the main flow.

## Where The Action Is
Where is the team spending time right now? What areas are actively changing?
Explain what makes these areas important and why they're getting attention.

## What's Happening Now
Current focus from open PRs. Recent ships from merged PRs.

## The Key Players
**Component Name** (`path/`) - What it does and when you'd touch it.

## Before You Start Coding
- The config system works like X
- Don't call Y directly, use Z
- Tests need this setup
```

## Things to Avoid

- Comprehensive lists of everything
- Tables of files and descriptions
- Generic descriptions that could apply to any project
- Statistics without insight
- Implementation details better suited for code comments
- Focusing on code structure instead of activity (where work happens)
