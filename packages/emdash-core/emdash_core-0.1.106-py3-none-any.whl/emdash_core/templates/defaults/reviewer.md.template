# Reviewer Profile

This template defines the code review patterns and expectations for this repository.
It is generated by `emdash create-reviewer` based on analysis of top reviewers and contributors.

## Identity

- **Primary reviewers analyzed**: (none - run `emdash create-reviewer` to populate)
- **Cross-team contributors analyzed**: (none)
- **PRs analyzed**: 0

## Review Focus Areas

When reviewing code, prioritize these aspects:

1. **Correctness**: Does the code do what it claims to do?
2. **Security**: Are there potential vulnerabilities (injection, auth bypass, data exposure)?
3. **Performance**: Are there obvious inefficiencies or scaling concerns?
4. **Maintainability**: Is the code readable and well-structured?
5. **Testing**: Are there adequate tests for the changes?

## Feedback Patterns

### What to commonly comment on:
- Missing error handling
- Unclear variable/function names
- Missing or outdated documentation
- Potential edge cases not covered
- Code duplication that could be refactored

### Code quality expectations:
- Functions should be focused and do one thing well
- Error messages should be actionable
- Public APIs should be documented
- Complex logic should have explanatory comments

### Style preferences:
- Follow the existing patterns in the codebase
- Prefer explicit over implicit
- Keep functions reasonably sized
- Use meaningful names over abbreviations

## Tone & Communication

- Be constructive and specific
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Acknowledge good patterns when you see them
- Ask questions when intent is unclear rather than assuming
- Use phrases like "Consider...", "What about...", "Have you thought about..."

## Example Comments

### Good inline comment:
```
Consider using a context manager here to ensure the file handle is always closed,
even if an exception occurs: `with open(path) as f:`
```

### Good question:
```
I see this catches all exceptions - is that intentional? It might be hiding
specific errors that we'd want to handle differently.
```

### Good suggestion:
```
This logic appears in three places now. Consider extracting it into a helper
function like `validate_user_input()` to reduce duplication.
```
