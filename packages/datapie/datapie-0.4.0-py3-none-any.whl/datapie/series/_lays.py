    ==Overlay the current series with another series by span==

    Overlay the values of another time series onto the current time series on the
    entire span of the other time series, i.e. from the start to the end period
    regardless of missing in-sample values.


        self.overlay_by_span(other, )


    ### Input arguments ###

    ???+ input "self"
        The current time series object.

    ???+ input "other"
        The time series object whose values will be overlaid onto the current time
        series.

    ???+ input "method"
        The method to use for overlaying the values. The default (and currently the
        only available) method is `"by_span"`.


    ### Returns ###

    This method modifies `self` in place and returns `None`.


    ### Details ###

        The resulting time series is determined the following way:

        1. The span of the resulting series starts at the earliest start period of the two
        series and ends at the latest end period of the two series.

        2. The observations from the `self` (current) time series used to fill the
        resulting time span.

        3. Within the span of the `other` time series (from the first available
        observation to the last available observation), the observations from this
        `other` time series are superimposed on the resulting time series, including any
        in-sample missing observations.
