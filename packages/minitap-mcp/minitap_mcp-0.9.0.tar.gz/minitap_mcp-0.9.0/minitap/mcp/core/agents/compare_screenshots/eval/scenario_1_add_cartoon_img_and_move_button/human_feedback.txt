6 differences found :
- Add button moved and restyled
The “+ Add” button is now at the top instead of the bottom, and its style is very different. This is a big layout change — confirm with design.

- Title typo
“Languges” should be “Languages”.

- Subtitle casing
The subtitle should be sentence case (“You are learning”), not title case.

- Extra robot illustration
A large yellow robot was added but isn’t in the design. Confirm if it should be there.

- Extra sub-label in list item
“Norwegian” has a second line (“from French”), which isn’t part of the design. Check if this is intended.

- Missing small “M” icon
The red “M” in the bottom-right is missing.
