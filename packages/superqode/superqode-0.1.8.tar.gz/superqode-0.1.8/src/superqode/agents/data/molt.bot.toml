# OpenClaw

OpenClaw provides an ACP bridge that connects SuperQode to a running OpenClaw Gateway.

## Requirements

- OpenClaw Gateway must be running and reachable
- Node.js 22+ runtime

## Connect

```bash
# Start the gateway (in a separate terminal)
moltbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose

# Connect from SuperQode
superqode connect acp moltbot
```

If your gateway requires auth, add `--token` or `--password` to the ACP command or set the
corresponding environment variables.
