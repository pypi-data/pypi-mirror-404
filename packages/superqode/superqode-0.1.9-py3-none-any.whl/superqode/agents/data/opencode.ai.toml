# OpenCode

**The AI coding agent built for the terminal**

OpenCode is an open source agent that helps you write and run code directly from the terminal with a flexible client/server architecture.

## Key Features

- **Client/Server Architecture**: Run OpenCode on your computer while controlling it remotely
- **Terminal-Native**: Built for developers who work in the command line
- **Multi-LLM Support**: Works with various AI providers
- **GitHub Integration**: Deep integration with GitHub workflows

## ACP Integration

OpenCode supports the Agent Client Protocol via the **opencode-acp** adapter by josephschmitt. This adapter:
- Launches a per-session MCP HTTP server
- Proxies file and terminal actions back to ACP
- Translates OpenCode streaming updates to ACP notifications
- Enables OpenCode to work with ACP-compatible editors

The ACP adapter allows standardized communication between OpenCode and various development tools.

## Installation

Install OpenCode globally:
```bash
npm i -g opencode-ai
```

For ACP support, install the adapter from:
https://github.com/josephschmitt/opencode-acp
