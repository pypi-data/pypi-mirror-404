"""Sampler module for Entropy population generation.

The sampler is a generic spec interpreter that generates agents from a
PopulationSpec. It doesn't know about surgeons or farmers - it just
executes whatever spec it's given.

Usage:
    from entropy.sampler import sample_population, save_json, save_sqlite

    result = sample_population(spec, count=500, seed=42)
    save_json(result, "agents.json")
    # or
    save_sqlite(result, "agents.db")

Pipeline Position:
    1. entropy spec → base spec (surgeons.yaml)
    2. entropy extend → merged spec (surgeons_ai.yaml) — optional
    3. entropy sample → agents from whichever spec you provide
