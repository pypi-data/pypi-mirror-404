"""Network generation module for Entropy.

Creates realistic social graphs between agents sampled from a PopulationSpec.
The goal is to model how professionals are connected through work relationships,
professional societies, and informal ties.

Usage:
    from entropy.network import generate_network, NetworkConfig, NetworkResult

    # Load agents from JSON
    agents = load_agents_json("agents.json")

    # Generate network with default config
    result = generate_network(agents)
    result.save_json("network.json")

    # Generate with custom config and compute metrics
    config = NetworkConfig(avg_degree=25, rewire_prob=0.1)
    result = generate_network_with_metrics(agents, config)

Key Concepts:
    - Homophily: People preferentially connect with similar others
    - Small-World: High clustering + short path lengths
    - Weak Ties: Sparse connections between clusters
    - Degree Distribution: Some nodes are hubs (opinion leaders)

Algorithm:
    1. Compute weighted similarity between agent pairs
    2. Sample edges proportional to similarity
    3. Apply degree correction for high-influence agents
    4. Add Watts-Strogatz rewiring for small-world properties

Edge Types:
    - colleague: Same employer + similar experience
    - mentor_mentee: Same employer + large experience gap
    - society: Same specialty + both society members
    - conference: Same specialty + met at conferences
    - regional: Same region + different specialty
    - weak_tie: Random rewiring (incidental connection)
