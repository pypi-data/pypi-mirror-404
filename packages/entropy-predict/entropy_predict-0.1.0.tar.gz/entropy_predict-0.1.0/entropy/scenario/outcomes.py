"""Step 4: Define Outcomes.

Generates minimal structured outcomes for simulation:
1. One categorical outcome (the primary decision)
2. One float outcome (sentiment)

All other insights are captured in the agent's reasoning text and can be
extracted post-hoc during analysis. This approach is:
- More reliable (fewer extraction errors)
- Faster (simpler schema for LLM)
- More powerful (reasoning captures emergent behaviors not pre-defined)

Create ONE categorical decision outcome that captures what agents will decide/do.

- Options should be short, clear, in snake_case
- Cover the full spectrum of possible responses (including neutral/undecided)

- cancel_decision: [will_cancel, considering, staying, undecided]
- compliance_stance: [full_compliance, partial_compliance, resist, undecided]"""
