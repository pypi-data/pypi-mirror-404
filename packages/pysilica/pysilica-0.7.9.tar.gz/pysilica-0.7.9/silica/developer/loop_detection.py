**To break out of this loop, you should:**
1. Analyze WHY the output isn't changing - what's blocking progress?
2. Try a DIFFERENT approach or tool
3. If you're waiting for something to change, explicitly check what you're waiting for

# System prompt addition to help prevent loops
LOOP_PREVENTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
## Tool Use Repetition

When making tool calls, avoid repeating the exact same call multiple times expecting different results. If you need to:

1. **Poll or wait for changes**: Add a descriptive comment in your reasoning explaining what you're waiting for, and consider using a different approach (e.g., checking specific conditions rather than re-running the same command)

2. **Retry after making changes**: Ensure you've actually made changes before re-running a test or check

3. **Verify state**: If checking the same thing multiple times, vary your approach (e.g., check a specific file, run a specific test, rather than running the full test suite repeatedly)

If you find yourself about to make the same tool call with the same inputs as your previous call, STOP and reconsider:
- Did you make any changes since the last call?
- Are you expecting a different result? Why?
- Is there a more targeted check you could do instead?
