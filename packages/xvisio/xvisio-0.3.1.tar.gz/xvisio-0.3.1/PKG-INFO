# XvisioTech Camera Examples

This repository contains the driver and examples for using [XvisioTech](https://www.xvisiotech.com/) devices:

- **XR-50** - 6DoF SLAM tracking camera with stereo fisheye, RGB, and IMU
- **DS-80** - 6DoF SLAM tracking camera with ToF depth sensor
- **Seer Wireless Controller** - 6DoF motion controller with buttons and joystick

It provides the necessary instructions to install the driver, set up the ROS2 package, and get started with the devices.

## ROS-free Python SDK (Recommended for scripting)

This repo includes a **ROS-free** Python package, `xvisio`, built with **nanobind**. It lets you access **Pose (SLAM)**, **IMU**, and **Controller** data directly from Python with minimal setup.

**Supported devices:**
- XR-50 / DS-80 cameras (pose, IMU)
- Seer wireless controller (pose, buttons, joystick)

### Quick start (pip install)

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install xvisio

# Install with visualization examples (includes viser)
pip install xvisio[examples]

# Run system setup (one-time, requires sudo)
sudo xvisio-setup

# Test installation
python3 -c "import xvisio; print(xvisio.discover())"
```

View the package at [pypi.org/project/xvisio/](https://pypi.org/project/xvisio/).

**Running examples after pip install:**

Examples are included in the pip package. Use the `xvisio-examples` command:

```bash
# List available examples
xvisio-examples --list

# Copy examples to local directory
xvisio-examples --copy
cd xvisio_examples
python demo_pose_imu.py
```

See [PIP_INSTALL.md](PIP_INSTALL.md) for more details on running examples.

### Quick start (source checkout)

#### 1) Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xvisiotech/xvisiotech_camera_examples.git
cd xvisiotech_camera_examples
```

#### 2) Run system setup (one-time, requires sudo)

This installs the USB udev rule and the XVSDK driver `.deb`:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/setup_host.sh
```

If the script adds you to the `plugdev` group, **log out and log back in** once.

#### 3) Install the Python package

```bash
pip install -e . --no-build-isolation
```

#### 4) Run the demo

```bash
python examples/demo_pose_imu.py
```

Or visualize the pose in 3D:

```bash
python examples/demo_pose_visualization.py
# Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
```

Or use the Python API directly:

```python
import xvisio

with xvisio.open() as dev:
    dev.enable(slam=True, imu=True)
    pose = dev.pose_world_aligned()
    imu = dev.imu()
    print(pose.position, imu.accel)
```

### Development installation (pixi)

For development, use pixi:

```bash
# Install pixi
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash

# Run host setup (one-time, requires sudo)
sudo ./scripts/setup_host.sh

# Install Python package
pixi run install

# Run demo
pixi run demo_pose_imu
```

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for detailed installation instructions.

<!-- TODO: Remove this section when PyPI is published (PyPI instructions moved to top) -->

### Minimal usage example

**Camera (XR-50 / DS-80):**
```python
import xvisio

with xvisio.open() as dev:
    dev.enable(slam=True, imu=True)

    pose = dev.pose()
    imu = dev.imu()

    print(pose.position, pose.quat_wxyz, pose.confidence)
    print(imu.accel, imu.gyro)
```

**Seer Wireless Controller:**
```python
import xvisio

# Open controller (auto-detects on /dev/ttyUSB0)
dev = xvisio.open_controller()

left, right = dev.controller()
if right:
    print(right.position, right.quat_wxyz)
    print(f"trigger={right.key_trigger}, side={right.key_side}")
    print(f"rocker=({right.rocker_x}, {right.rocker_y}), key={right.key}")

dev.close()
```

### Running tests

- Unit tests (no hardware needed):

```bash
pixi run test
```

- Hardware smoke test (requires a connected device):

```bash
XVISIO_HARDWARE=1 pixi run test
```

For more details on the Python API, see `python/README.md`.

### Version Management and Publishing

The project includes tools for managing versions and publishing wheels to PyPI.

#### Version Management

Check current version:
```bash
pixi run version
```

Set a specific version:
```bash
pixi run version 0.2.0
```

Bump version automatically:
```bash
# Bump patch version (0.1.0 -> 0.1.1)
pixi run version --bump patch

# Bump minor version (0.1.0 -> 0.2.0)
pixi run version --bump minor

# Bump major version (0.1.0 -> 1.0.0)
pixi run version --bump major
```

#### Building Distributions

Build wheel and source distribution:
```bash
pixi run build-dist
```

Build wheel only:
```bash
pixi run build-wheel
```

Build source distribution only:
```bash
pixi run build-sdist
```

#### Publishing to PyPI

**1. Test on TestPyPI first (recommended):**
```bash
# Build distributions
pixi run build-dist

# Upload to TestPyPI
pixi run upload-testpypi

# Test installation (use --extra-index-url to also check PyPI for build dependencies)
pip install --index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ xvisio
```

**2. Publish to PyPI:**
```bash
# Build distributions
pixi run build-dist

# Upload to PyPI
pixi run upload-pypi
```

**Note:** You'll need to configure PyPI credentials in `~/.pypirc` before uploading. See [PUBLISHING.md](PUBLISHING.md) for detailed instructions.

For complete publishing workflow and troubleshooting, see [PUBLISHING.md](PUBLISHING.md).

## Instructions (Docker Container) -- Recommended

If your goal is **ROS-free Python scripting**, use the **ROS-free Python SDK** section above (pixi + `xvisio`). This Docker flow is mainly for the **ROS2 driver** workflow (RViz, ROS topics, launch files).

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure you have Docker installed on your system. If you don't have Docker installed, you can follow the instructions provided on [the official Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository). Make sure to use `apt-get` to install it, instead of `docker-desktop` GUI app installation, as it may not work with the provided scripts.

#### Docker Setup:

If you haven't done this before, add the user to the docker group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Log out and log back in for the group change to take effect. Alternatively, run:

```bash
newgrp docker
```

Note that to be able to run examples with GUIs, make sure graphics forwarding (x11) is enabled in your docker settings. We have added this in the provided scripts for convenience, but you may need to enable it manually if you are using a different setup.
```bash
xhost +local:docker
```

Make sure the device is connected to the host machine and the camera is powered on. If you have just received the camera, you may need to update the firmware to the latest version. Please refer to the "Update Firmware" section below for instructions.

### Installation

Start the Docker container with the necessary dependencies and the camera driver installed:

```bash
./scripts/start_container.sh
```

Once the docker image is built and the container is started, you can proceed with setting up the ROS2 package in the container.

Test the driver installation by running the following command:
```bash
sudo all_stream
```

This command will display the output of the camera in the terminal. If the camera is connected and working properly, you should see the camera's output in the terminal (pose and IMU signals) and camera images.

To set up the ROS2 package for the XvisioTech camera, follow these steps in the container:
```bash
source ./scripts/setup_ros2_driver.sh
```
Make sure to `source` the script to set up the ROS2 package in the current shell. Just running the script without `source` will not set up the ROS2 package in the current shell.

### Usage

This script will build the ROS2 package. You can then launch the ROS2 node using the following command in the container:
```bash
ros2 launch xv_sdk_ros2 xv_sdk_node_launch.py
```

To verify the installation and setup, you can listen to the camera's pose topic or visualize it using RViz (in a new shell) as follows:

Open a new shell in the container currently running the ROS2 node:
```bash
./scripts/open_shell.sh
```

You can listen to pose topic in the new shell:
```bash
ros2 topic echo /xv_sdk/<camera_serial_id>/pose
```
<camera_serial_id> is the serial number of the camera that shows up in the topic list (e.g., `SNXR501G10002222006246`).


You can also visualize the camera pose in RViz (in the new shell):
```bash
rviz2 -d ./xvisio-camera-test.rviz
```

### Optional Features

The XvisioTech camera driver supports several optional features that can be enabled or disabled through launch parameters. By default, most features are disabled to reduce CPU usage and bandwidth, except for SLAM pose and button states which are enabled by default. You can enable specific features based on your requirements.

To enable a feature, add the corresponding parameter to the launch command:

```bash
ros2 launch xv_sdk_ros2 xv_sdk_node_launch.py <parameter_name>:=true
```

Available parameters:

- **fisheye_enable**: Enable fisheye camera images (default: false)
- **rgb_enable**: Enable RGB camera images (default: false)
- **tof_enable**: Enable Time-of-Flight depth camera (default: false)
- **rgbd_enable**: Enable RGB-D combined data (default: false)
- **button_states_enable**: Enable button state publishing (default: true)
- **event_enable**: Enable event data publishing (default: false)
- **orientation_enable**: Enable orientation data publishing (default: false)
- **slam_path_enable**: Enable SLAM trajectory publishing (default: false)
- **slam_pose_enable**: Enable SLAM pose publishing (default: true)

For example, to enable fisheye cameras and RGB images:

```bash
ros2 launch xv_sdk_ros2 xv_sdk_node_launch.py fisheye_enable:=true rgb_enable:=true
```

To disable button states (which are enabled by default):

```bash
ros2 launch xv_sdk_ros2 xv_sdk_node_launch.py button_states_enable:=false
```

Enabling these features will make the corresponding topics available for subscription. Disabling them will prevent the topics from being created, reducing CPU usage and network bandwidth.

## Update Firmware

If you just received the camera, you may need to update the firmware to the latest version.

To update the camera firmware, use the latest firmware image file in the `firmware` folder and run the following command inside the container shell (choose the correct firmware file for your camera model):
```
./xvisioUpdateImg <firmware_file>
```

Wait until `Done` is displayed in the terminal to complete the firmware update. After the update is complete, restart the camera by disconnecting and reconnecting the USB cable. Note that this step needs to be done only once.


## Instructions with Manual Installation

This section is only for reference. We recommend using the Docker container as it is easier to install and use.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure your system is running Ubuntu22.04 and ROS2 Humble.

### Updating Ubuntu

Ensure your Ubuntu distribution is up to date, including the latest stable kernel:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

### Dependency Installation

Install the dependent libraries required for the camera driver:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y tree g++ cmake cmake-curses-gui pkg-config autoconf libtool libudev-dev libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev libopencv-dev rapidjson-dev libeigen3-dev libboost-thread-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-date-time-dev liboctomap-dev
```


### USB Permissions

Set up USB permissions by downloading the permissions file and copying it to the correct directory:

1. Download `99-xvisio.rules`.
2. Open a terminal in the directory where you downloaded the file and run:

```bash
sudo cp 99-xvisio.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```

The camera driver is now installed and ready to use. You can proceed to the next section to set up the ROS2 package and start using the camera.



### Driver Installation

Install the XvisioTech camera driver using the provided Debian package:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i XVSDK_jammy_amd64_022324.deb
```

Test the installation by running the following command:

```bash
sudo all_stream
```

This command will display the output of the camera in the terminal. If the camera is connected and working properly, you should see the camera's output in the terminal (pose and IMU signals) and camera images.

## Setting Up ROS2 Package

To set up the ROS2 package for the XvisioTech camera, follow these steps:

1. Create a ros2 workspace (copy the package into existing one) and build the package:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cp xvsdk-ros2 ~/ros2_ws/src/
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select xv_ros2_msgs
colcon build --packages-select xv_sdk_ros2
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
```

2. Launch the ROS2 node:

```bash
ros2 launch xv_sdk_ros2 xv_sdk_node_launch.py
```


## Usage

To verify the installation and setup, you can listen to the camera's pose topic or visualize it using RViz:

- Listen to pose topic:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /xv_sdk/slam/pose
```

- Visualize the camera pose in RViz:

```bash
rviz2 -d ./xvisio-camera-test.rviz
```

The RViz window will open and display the camera's pose in the 3D space. You can also view the images from the camera (fish-eye stereo and RGB images) in the RViz window.
