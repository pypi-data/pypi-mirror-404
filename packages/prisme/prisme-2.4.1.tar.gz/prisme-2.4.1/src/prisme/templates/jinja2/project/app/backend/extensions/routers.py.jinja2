"""Custom API routers for {{ project_name }}.

Add custom FastAPI routers here. These will be discovered
automatically by the composition root and included in the app.

Example::

    from fastapi import APIRouter

    router = APIRouter(prefix="/custom", tags=["custom"])

    @router.get("/hello")
    async def hello():
        return {"message": "Hello from custom router"}
"""

from fastapi import APIRouter

router = APIRouter()
