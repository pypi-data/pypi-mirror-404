def area_tri() -> float:

  """

  Returns the area size of the 2D or 3D triangle defined.

  """

  ...

def barycentric_transform() -> mathutils.Vector:

  """

  Return a transformed point, the transformation is defined by 2 triangles.

  """

  ...

def box_fit_2d() -> float:

  """

  Returns an angle that best fits the points to an axis aligned rectangle

  """

def box_pack_2d() -> typing.Any:

  """

  Returns a tuple with the width and height of the packed bounding box.

  """

  ...

def closest_point_on_tri() -> mathutils.Vector:

  """

  Takes 4 vectors: one is the point and the next 3 define the triangle.

  """

  ...

def convex_hull_2d() -> typing.List[int]:

  """

  Returns a list of indices into the list given

  """

def delaunay_2d_cdt() -> typing.Any:

  """

  Computes the Constrained Delaunay Triangulation of a set of vertices,
with edges and faces that must appear in the triangulation.
Some triangles may be eaten away, or combined with other triangles,
according to output type.
The returned verts may be in a different order from input verts, may be moved
slightly, and may be merged with other nearby verts.
The three returned orig lists give, for each of verts, edges, and faces, the list of
input element indices corresponding to the positionally same output element.
For edges, the orig indices start with the input edges and then continue
with the edges implied by each of the faces (n of them for an n-gon).
If the need_ids argument is supplied, and False, then the code skips the preparation
of the orig arrays, which may save some time.

  Returns the signed distance between a point and a plane    (negative when below the normal).
