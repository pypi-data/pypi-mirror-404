"""Carcinize - Rust-like types for Python.

This package provides Rust-inspired data types for Python:

- Result: A type representing either success (Ok) or failure (Err)
- Option: A type representing an optional value (Some or Nothing)
- Struct: Pydantic-based structs with Rust-like semantics
- Iter: Fluent iterator with chainable combinators
- Lazy/OnceCell: Thread-safe lazy initialization primitives
