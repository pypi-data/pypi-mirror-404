class WaterCirculator(Juham):
    """Hot Water Circulation Automation

    This system monitors motion sensor data to detect home occupancy.

    - **When motion is detected**: The water circulator pump is activated, ensuring hot water is
        instantly available when the tap is turned on.
    - **When no motion is detected for a specified period (in seconds)**: The pump automatically
        switches off to conserve energy.

    Future improvement idea
    ------------------------

    In cold countries, such as Finland, energy conservation during the winter season may not be a priority.
    In this case, an additional temperature sensor measuring the outside temperature could be used to determine whether
    the circulator should be switched off at all. The circulating water could potentially act as an additional heating radiator.

    Points to consider
    ------------------

    - Switching the pump on and off may affect its lifetime.
    - Keeping the pump running with hot water could impact the lifespan of the pipes, potentially causing
      corrosion due to constant hot water flow.
