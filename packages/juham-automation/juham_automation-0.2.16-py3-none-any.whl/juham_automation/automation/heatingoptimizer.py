    water radiators. Reads spot prices, solar electricity forecast, temperature forecast, power meter and
    the current temperature of the system to be heated to optimize energyc consumption and 
    minimize electricity bill.

    Represents a heating system that knows the power rating of its radiator (e.g., 3kW).
    Any number of heating devices can co-exist, each with its own heating optimizer with 
    different temperature, schedule and electricity price ratings.

    The system subscribes to the 'power' topic to track the current power balance. If the solar panels
    generate more energy than is being consumed, the optimizer activates a relay to ensure that all excess energy
    produced within that balancing interval is used for heating. The goal is to achieve a net zero energy 
    balance for each slot, ensuring that any surplus energy from the solar panels is fully utilized.

    The heating plan is published to 'topic_powerplan' topic for monitoring purposes.
    Radiator relay state is published to 'power' topic, to actualize the heating plan.

    Computes also UOI - optimization utilization index for each slot, based on the spot price and the solar power forecast.
    For negative energy balance this determines when energy is consumed. Value of 0 means the slot is expensive, 
    value of 1 means the slot is free. The UOI threshold determines the slots that are allowed to be consumed.

        High thresholds indicate that the radiator should remain operational regardless of the price.
        Low thresholds imply the radiator can be turned off during expensive periods, suggesting it
