[SYSTEM VALIDATION FAILED]

Your previous response claimed to perform an action (like writing to a file, scheduling a task, etc.) but you did NOT actually call any tools.

This is a CRITICAL ERROR. You MUST use the appropriate tool to perform the action. Do not just describe what you would do - actually call the tool now.

If the required tool is not available, explain that clearly instead of pretending to have done the action.
