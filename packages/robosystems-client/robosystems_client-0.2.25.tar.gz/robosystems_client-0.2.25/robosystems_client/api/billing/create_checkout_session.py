  """Create Payment Checkout Session

   Create a Stripe checkout session for collecting payment method.

  This endpoint is used when an organization owner needs to add a payment method before
  provisioning resources. It creates a pending subscription and redirects
  to Stripe Checkout to collect payment details.

  **Flow:**
  1. Owner tries to create a graph but org has no payment method
  2. Frontend calls this endpoint with graph configuration
  3. Backend creates a subscription in PENDING_PAYMENT status for the user's org
  4. Returns Stripe Checkout URL
  5. User completes payment on Stripe
  6. Webhook activates subscription and provisions resource

  **Requirements:**
  - User must be an OWNER of their organization
  - Enterprise customers (with invoice_billing_enabled) should not call this endpoint.

  Args:
      body (CreateCheckoutRequest): Request to create a checkout session for payment collection.

  Raises:
      errors.UnexpectedStatus: If the server returns an undocumented status code and Client.raise_on_unexpected_status is True.
