  """Get Runtime Graph Schema

   Get runtime schema information for the specified graph database.

  ## What This Returns

  This endpoint inspects the **actual current state** of the graph database and returns:
  - **Node Labels**: All node types currently in the database
  - **Relationship Types**: All relationship types currently in the database
  - **Node Properties**: Properties discovered from actual data (up to 10 properties per node type)

  ## Runtime vs Declared Schema

  **Use this endpoint** (`/schema`) when you need to know:
  - What data is ACTUALLY in the database right now
  - What properties exist on real nodes
  - What relationships have been created
  - Current database structure for querying

  **Use `/schema/export` instead** when you need:
  - The original schema definition used to create the graph
  - Schema in a specific format (JSON, YAML, Cypher DDL)
  - Schema for documentation or version control
  - Schema to replicate in another graph

  ## Example Use Cases

  - **Building queries**: See what node labels and properties exist to write accurate Cypher
  - **Data exploration**: Discover what's in an unfamiliar graph
  - **Schema drift detection**: Compare runtime vs declared schema
  - **API integration**: Dynamically adapt to current graph structure

  ## Performance Note

  Property discovery is limited to 10 properties per node type for performance.
  For complete schema definitions, use `/schema/export`.

  ## Subgraph Support

  This endpoint accepts both parent graph IDs and subgraph IDs.
  - Parent graph: Use `graph_id` like `kg0123456789abcdef`
  - Subgraph: Use full subgraph ID like `kg0123456789abcdef_dev`
  Each subgraph has independent schema and data. The returned schema reflects
  only the specified graph/subgraph's actual structure.

  This operation is included - no credit consumption required.

  Args:
      graph_id (str):

  Raises:
      errors.UnexpectedStatus: If the server returns an undocumented status code and Client.raise_on_unexpected_status is True.
      httpx.TimeoutException: If the request takes longer than Client.timeout.

  Returns:
