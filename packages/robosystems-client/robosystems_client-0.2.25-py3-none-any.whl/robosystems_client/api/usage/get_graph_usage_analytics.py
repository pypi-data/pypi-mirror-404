  """Get Graph Usage Analytics

   Get comprehensive usage analytics tracked by the GraphUsage model.

  Provides temporal usage patterns including:
  - **Storage Analytics**: GB-hours for billing, breakdown by type (files, tables, graphs, subgraphs)
  - **Credit Analytics**: Consumption patterns, operation breakdown, cached vs billable
  - **Performance Insights**: Operation stats, slow queries, performance scoring
  - **Recent Events**: Latest usage events with full details

  Time ranges available:
  - `24h` - Last 24 hours (hourly breakdown)
  - `7d` - Last 7 days (daily breakdown)
  - `30d` - Last 30 days (daily breakdown)
  - `current_month` - Current billing month
  - `last_month` - Previous billing month

  Include options:
  - `storage` - Storage usage summary (GB-hours, averages, peaks)
  - `credits` - Credit consumption analytics
  - `performance` - Performance insights and optimization opportunities
  - `events` - Recent usage events (last 50)

  Useful for:
  - Billing and cost analysis
  - Capacity planning
  - Performance optimization
  - Usage trend analysis

  Note:
  This operation is included - no credit consumption required.
