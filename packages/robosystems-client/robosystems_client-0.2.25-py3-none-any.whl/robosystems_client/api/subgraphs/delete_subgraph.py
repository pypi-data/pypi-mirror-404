   Delete a subgraph database.

  **Requirements:**
  - Must be a valid subgraph (not parent graph)
  - User must have admin access to parent graph
  - Subgraph name must be alphanumeric (1-20 characters)
  - Optional backup before deletion

  **Deletion Options:**
  - `force`: Delete even if contains data
  - `backup_first`: Create backup before deletion

  **Warning:**
  Deletion is permanent unless backup is created.
  All data in the subgraph will be lost.

  **Backup Location:**
  If backup requested, stored in S3 graph database bucket at:
  `s3://{graph_s3_bucket}/{instance_id}/{database_name}_{timestamp}.backup`

  **Notes:**
  - Use the subgraph name (e.g., 'dev', 'staging') not the full subgraph ID
  - Deletion does not affect parent graph's credit pool or permissions
  - Backup creation consumes credits from parent graph's allocation

  Args:
      graph_id (str):
      subgraph_name (str): Subgraph name to delete (e.g., 'dev', 'staging')
      body (DeleteSubgraphRequest): Request model for deleting a subgraph.
