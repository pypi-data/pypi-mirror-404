  """Create Subgraph

   Create a new subgraph within a parent graph, with optional data forking.

  **Requirements:**
  - Valid authentication
  - Parent graph must exist and be accessible to the user
  - User must have 'admin' permission on the parent graph
  - Parent graph tier must support subgraphs (LadybugDB Large/XLarge or Neo4j Enterprise XLarge)
  - Must be within subgraph quota limits
  - Subgraph name must be unique within the parent graph

  **Fork Mode:**
  When `fork_parent=true`, the operation:
  - Returns immediately with an operation_id for SSE monitoring
  - Copies data from parent graph to the new subgraph
  - Supports selective forking via metadata.fork_options
  - Tracks progress in real-time via SSE

  **Returns:**
  - Without fork: Immediate SubgraphResponse with created subgraph details
  - With fork: Operation response with SSE monitoring endpoint

  **Subgraph ID format:** `{parent_id}_{subgraph_name}` (e.g., kg1234567890abcdef_dev)

  **Usage:**
  - Subgraphs share parent's credit pool
  - Subgraph ID can be used in all standard `/v1/graphs/{graph_id}/*` endpoints
  - Permissions inherited from parent graph

  Args:
      graph_id (str):
      body (CreateSubgraphRequest): Request model for creating a subgraph.

  Raises:
      errors.UnexpectedStatus: If the server returns an undocumented status code and Client.raise_on_unexpected_status is True.
      httpx.TimeoutException: If the request takes longer than Client.timeout.

  Returns:
