  """Get Available Schema Extensions

   List all available schema extensions for graph creation.

  Schema extensions provide pre-built industry-specific data models that extend
  the base graph schema with specialized nodes, relationships, and properties.

  **Available Extensions:**
  - **RoboLedger**: Complete accounting system with XBRL reporting, general ledger, and financial
  statements
  - **RoboInvestor**: Investment portfolio management and tracking
  - **RoboSCM**: Supply chain management and logistics
  - **RoboFO**: Front office operations and CRM
  - **RoboHRM**: Human resources management
  - **RoboEPM**: Enterprise performance management
  - **RoboReport**: Business intelligence and reporting

  **Extension Information:**
  Each extension includes:
  - Display name and description
  - Node and relationship counts
  - Context-aware capabilities (e.g., SEC repositories get different features than entity graphs)

  **Use Cases:**
  - Browse available extensions before creating a graph
  - Understand extension capabilities and data models
  - Plan graph schema based on business requirements
  - Combine multiple extensions for comprehensive data modeling

  **Note:**
  Extension listing is included - no credit consumption required.

  Raises:
      errors.UnexpectedStatus: If the server returns an undocumented status code and Client.raise_on_unexpected_status is True.
      httpx.TimeoutException: If the request takes longer than Client.timeout.

  Returns:
