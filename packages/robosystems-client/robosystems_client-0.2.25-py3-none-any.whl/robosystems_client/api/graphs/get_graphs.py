  r"""Get User Graphs and Repositories

   List all graph databases and shared repositories accessible to the current user.

  Returns a unified list of both user-created graphs and shared repositories (like SEC data)
  that the user has access to, including their role/access level and selection status.

  **Returned Information:**
  - Graph/Repository ID and display name
  - User's role/access level (admin/member for graphs, read/write/admin for repositories)
  - Selection status (only user graphs can be selected)
  - Creation timestamp
  - Repository type indicator (isRepository: true for shared repositories)

  **User Graphs (isRepository: false):**
  - Collaborative workspaces that can be shared with other users
  - Roles: `admin` (full access, can invite users) or `member` (read/write access)
  - Can be selected as active workspace
  - Graphs you create or have been invited to

  **Shared Repositories (isRepository: true):**
  - Read-only data repositories like SEC filings, industry benchmarks
  - Access levels: `read`, `write` (for data contributions), `admin`
  - Cannot be selected (each has separate subscription)
  - Require separate subscriptions (personal, cannot be shared)

  **Selected Graph Concept:**
  The \"selected\" graph is the user's currently active workspace (user graphs only).
  Many API operations default to the selected graph if no graph_id is provided.
  Users can change their selected graph via `POST /v1/graphs/{graph_id}/select`.

  **Use Cases:**
  - Display unified graph/repository selector in UI
  - Show all accessible data sources (both owned graphs and subscribed repositories)
  - Identify currently active workspace
  - Filter by type (user graphs vs repositories)

  **Empty Response:**
  New users receive an empty list with `selectedGraphId: null`. Users should create
  a graph or subscribe to a repository.

  **Note:**
  Graph listing is included - no credit consumption required.

  Raises:
      errors.UnexpectedStatus: If the server returns an undocumented status code and Client.raise_on_unexpected_status is True.
      httpx.TimeoutException: If the request takes longer than Client.timeout.

  Returns:
