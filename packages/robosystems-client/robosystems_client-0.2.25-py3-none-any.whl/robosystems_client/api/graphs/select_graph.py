  """Select Graph

   Select a specific graph as the active workspace for the user.

  The selected graph becomes the default context for operations in client applications
  and can be used to maintain user workspace preferences across sessions.

  **Functionality:**
  - Sets the specified graph as the user's currently selected graph
  - Deselects any previously selected graph (only one can be selected at a time)
  - Persists selection across sessions until changed
  - Returns confirmation with the selected graph ID

  **Requirements:**
  - User must have access to the graph (as admin or member)
  - Graph must exist and not be deleted
  - User can only select graphs they have permission to access

  **Use Cases:**
  - Switch between multiple graphs in a multi-graph environment
  - Set default workspace after creating a new graph
  - Restore user's preferred workspace on login
  - Support graph context switching in client applications

  **Client Integration:**
  Many client operations can default to the selected graph, simplifying API calls
  by eliminating the need to specify graph_id repeatedly. Check the selected
  graph with `GET /v1/graphs` which returns `selectedGraphId`.

  **Note:**
  Graph selection is included - no credit consumption required.

  Args:
      graph_id (str):

  Raises:
      errors.UnexpectedStatus: If the server returns an undocumented status code and Client.raise_on_unexpected_status is True.
      httpx.TimeoutException: If the request takes longer than Client.timeout.
