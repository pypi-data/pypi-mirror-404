  """Database Health Check

   Get comprehensive health information for the graph database.

  Returns detailed health metrics including:
  - **Connection Status**: Database connectivity and responsiveness
  - **Performance Metrics**: Query execution times and throughput
  - **Resource Usage**: Memory and storage utilization
  - **Error Monitoring**: Recent error rates and patterns
  - **Uptime Statistics**: Service availability metrics

  Health indicators:
  - **Status**: healthy, degraded, or unhealthy
  - **Query Performance**: Average execution times
  - **Error Rates**: Recent failure percentages
  - **Resource Usage**: Memory and storage consumption
  - **Alerts**: Active warnings or issues

  **Subgraph Support:**
  This endpoint accepts both parent graph IDs and subgraph IDs.
  - Parent graph: Use `graph_id` like `kg0123456789abcdef`
  - Subgraph: Use full subgraph ID like `kg0123456789abcdef_dev`
  Health metrics are specific to the requested graph/subgraph. Subgraphs share the
  same physical instance as their parent but have independent health indicators.

  This endpoint provides essential monitoring data for operational visibility.

  Args:
      graph_id (str):

  Raises:
      errors.UnexpectedStatus: If the server returns an undocumented status code and Client.raise_on_unexpected_status is True.
      httpx.TimeoutException: If the request takes longer than Client.timeout.

  Returns:
