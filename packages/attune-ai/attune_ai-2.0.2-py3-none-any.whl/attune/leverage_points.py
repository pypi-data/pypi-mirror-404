"""Leverage Point Analysis for System Interventions

Identifies high-leverage intervention points based on Donella Meadows's
seminal work "Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System".

Leverage points are places within a complex system where a small shift
can produce big changes in system behavior.

    """Identifies high-leverage intervention points in AI-human systems

    Based on Donella Meadows's 12 leverage points. Helps identify where
    to intervene in a system for maximum effectiveness.

    **The 12 Leverage Points (in increasing order of effectiveness):**

    1. **Parameters**: Constants, numbers (e.g., change tax rate)
       - Least effective but easiest to change

    2. **Buffers**: Size of stabilizing stocks
       - Example: inventory sizes, account balances

    3. **Stock-Flow Structure**: Physical system structure
       - Example: road networks, factories

    4. **Delays**: Length of delays relative to rate of change
       - Example: feedback delay in learning systems

    5. **Balancing Feedback Loops**: Strength of stabilizing loops
       - Example: quality control mechanisms

    6. **Reinforcing Feedback Loops**: Strength of amplifying loops
       - Example: compound interest, viral growth

    7. **Information Flows**: Structure of information flows
       - Example: transparency, data access

    8. **Rules**: Incentives, punishments, constraints
       - Example: laws, policies, protocols

    9. **Self-Organization**: Power to evolve system structure
       - Example: ability to create new rules

    10. **Goals**: Purpose or function of the system
        - Example: shift from growth to sustainability

    11. **Paradigm**: Mindset underlying the system
        - Example: worldview, shared assumptions

    12. **Transcending Paradigms**: Keep perspective on all paradigms
        - Most effective but hardest to achieve

    Example:
        >>> analyzer = LeveragePointAnalyzer()
        >>> problem = {
        ...     "class": "documentation_burden",
        ...     "description": "Developers spend 40% time on repetitive docs",
