    """Thread-safe in-memory graph store implementing the GraphStore protocol.

    Provides storage for entities and relationships with efficient lookup
    via multiple indexes. All operations are thread-safe using RLock.

    Features:
    - O(1) entity and relationship lookup by ID
    - O(1) entity lookup by name (per user, case-insensitive)
    - O(1) lookup of relationships by source or target entity
    - BFS-based subgraph traversal with configurable hop limit
    - BFS-based shortest path finding between entities

    Indexes:
    - _entities: dict[str, Entity] - entity_id -> Entity
    - _relationships: dict[str, Relationship] - relationship_id -> Relationship
    - _entities_by_user: dict[str, set[str]] - user_id -> entity_ids
    - _entities_by_name: dict[str, dict[str, str]] - user_id -> {name_lower: entity_id}
    - _relationships_by_source: dict[str, set[str]] - entity_id -> relationship_ids (outgoing)
    - _relationships_by_target: dict[str, set[str]] - entity_id -> relationship_ids (incoming)

    Usage:
        store = InMemoryGraphStore()
        await store.add_entity(Entity(user_id="alice", name="Project X", entity_type="project"))
        entity = await store.get_entity_by_name("alice", "project x")  # Case-insensitive
