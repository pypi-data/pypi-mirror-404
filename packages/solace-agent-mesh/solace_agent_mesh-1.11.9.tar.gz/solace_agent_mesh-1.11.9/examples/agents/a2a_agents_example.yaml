  #       Use the Playwright MCP server to answer incoming questions through web browsing. The tools you have will allow
  #       you to navigate to, click on, and extract information from web pages. You must retrieve information to answer
  #       the incoming request, which might require visiting multiple pages and interacting with them. During this, you
  #       must return status_update messages to the user using embeds so it is clear what you are doing. Any files you get that
  #       might be useful should be saved using create_artifact.

        The MermaidAgent can generate PNG images from Mermaid diagram syntax.
        You will be provided with the Mermaid syntax as a string.
        Use the 'mermaid_diagram_generator' tool to create the PNG image.
        The tool accepts 'mermaid_syntax' (the diagram code) and an optional 'output_filename'.
        The generated image will be saved as a PNG artifact.
        Confirm completion by stating the name and version of the created artifact.

      instruction: |
        You are an agent that can fetch content from web URLs using the 'web_request' tool.
        You can make various types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) and include custom headers or a body.
        The tool will return the fetched content (HTML converted to Markdown, other text types as is, or raw binary data).
        You will then need to process this content based on the user's request.
        Always save useful fetched content as an artifact.

# --- Report Agent ---
  # - name: report_generation_agent_app
  #   app_base_path: .
  #   app_module: src.solace_agent_mesh.agent.sac.app
  #   broker:
  #     <<: *broker_connection

  #     agent_name: "ReportGenerationAgent"
  #     display_name: "Report Generator"
  #     model: *report_generation_model # Or another appropriate model from shared_config.yaml
  #     instruction: |
  #       You are an agent that is in charge of thinking through how to generate a report and
  #       then later generating it. When first asked about a report, you will create a plan
  #       for the report and respond with an outline of what the report should contain. The
  #       caller can then assemble all the required data for you to generate the report.
  #       Later you will be called back with a reference to the report outline and a list of
  #       all the data and resources needed to generate the report. 

  #       When creating the report, do it section by section and then assemble the final report
  #       from all the sections. Unless told otherwise, create a rich, well styled html report.
  #       It should contain the appropriate introduction and conclusion sections for the type of
  #       report you are generating. 

  #       It is important to provide useful illustrations, graphs and diagrams in the report as 
  #       appropriate. You can use the mermaid agent to generate diagrams, plotly tool for graphs
  #       and the image generation for additional images, but images should just be used for visual
  #       interest since they generally are not going to be guaranteed to have the exact content you expect.

  #         This agent works in two phases. It should first be consulted for a report outline and plan.
  #         It will return the outline to you and then you should use that outline to gather the data
  #         and resources needed to generate the report. Once you have all the data, you can call
  #         this agent again with the outline and the data and it will generate the report for you.
