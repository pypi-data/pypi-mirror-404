A Python client library for the Bria Engine API, designed to make integrating powerful image and video editing capabilities into your applications seamless and straightforward. The library provides both synchronous and asynchronous clients with flexible request execution modes.

## Installation

```bash
pip install bria-client
```

## Quick Start

Set your API key:

```bash
export BRIA_API_TOKEN="your-api-key-here"
```

Basic example:

```python
from bria_client import BriaSyncClient
from bria_client.toolkit.image import Image

client = BriaSyncClient()

# Process an image and get the result immediately
response = client.run(
    endpoint="image/edit/remove_background",
    payload={"image": Image("https://example.com/image.jpg").as_bria_api_input}
)

print(response.result)
```

## Usage Guide

### Two Client Types

Choose the client that fits your use case:

**`BriaSyncClient`** - For simple scripts and traditional applications
```python
from bria_client import BriaSyncClient

client = BriaSyncClient()
response = client.run(endpoint="image/edit/remove_background", payload={...})
```

**`BriaAsyncClient`** - For async applications and concurrent processing
```python
from bria_client import BriaAsyncClient

async def process_images():
    async with BriaAsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.run(endpoint="image/edit/remove_background", payload={...})
    return response

```

### Three Request Methods

**`.run()`** - Wait for immediate result
```python
# Good for quick operations
response = client.run(endpoint="image/edit/remove_background", payload={...})
print(response.result)
```

**`.submit()`** - Submit and continue working
```python
# Good for long operations - returns immediately with request_id
response = client.submit(endpoint="video/segment/mask_by_prompt", payload={...})
print(f"Submitted: {response.request_id}")
# Do other work...
```

**`.poll()`** - Wait for a submitted request to complete
```python
# Check request status until done
response = client.submit(endpoint="...", payload={...})
final = client.poll(response, interval=2, timeout=300)
print(final.result)
```

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from bria_client import BriaSyncClient
from bria_client.toolkit.image import Image

client = BriaSyncClient()

response = client.run(
    endpoint="image/edit/remove_background",
    payload={"image": Image("https://example.com/image.jpg").as_bria_api_input}
)

print(response.result)
```

### Batch Processing

```python
from bria_client import BriaSyncClient
from bria_client.toolkit.image import Image

client = BriaSyncClient()
images = ["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg", "image3.jpg"]

# Submit all requests
responses = [
    client.submit(
        endpoint="image/edit/remove_background",
        payload={"image": Image(img).as_bria_api_input}
    )
    for img in images
]

# Wait for all to complete
results = [client.poll(r, timeout=120) for r in responses]
print(f"Processed {len(results)} images")
```

### Async Processing

```python
import asyncio
from bria_client import BriaAsyncClient
from bria_client.toolkit.image import Image

async def process_images():
    async with BriaAsyncClient() as client:
        tasks = [
            client.run(
                endpoint="image/edit/remove_background",
                payload={"image": Image(url).as_bria_api_input}
            )
            for url in ["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg", "image3.jpg"]
        ]
        return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

results = asyncio.run(process_images())
```

### Error Handling

```python
try:
    response = client.run(endpoint="...", payload={...}, raise_for_status=True)
    print(response.result)
except TimeoutError:
    print("Request timed out")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager

### Installation

Install development and test dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --group dev
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality. Install them with:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

The following hooks run automatically on each commit:

| Hook | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `prettier` | Formats YAML and JSON files |
| `ruff-format` | Formats Python code |
| `ruff` | Lints Python code with auto-fix |
| `pyright` | Type checking |
| `uv-lock-check` | Ensures `uv.lock` is in sync with `pyproject.toml` |

To run all hooks manually:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature-name`
3. Make your changes and add tests
4. Run tests: `uv run pytest`
5. Submit a pull request

**Guidelines:**
