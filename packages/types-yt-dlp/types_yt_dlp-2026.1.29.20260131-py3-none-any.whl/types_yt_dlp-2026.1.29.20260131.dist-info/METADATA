## Typing stubs for yt-dlp

This is a [type stub package](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/external_libraries.html)
for the [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) package. It can be used by type checkers
to check code that uses `yt-dlp`. This version of
`types-yt-dlp` aims to provide accurate annotations for
`yt-dlp==2026.01.29`.

This package is part of the [typeshed project](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.
See [the README](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md)
for more details. The source for this package can be found in the
[`stubs/yt-dlp`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/yt-dlp)
directory.

This package was tested with the following type checkers:
* [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/) 1.19.1
* [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) 1.1.408

It was generated from typeshed commit
[`fa659b1def704dea3dc8e25c7857b23eac69df4d`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/fa659b1def704dea3dc8e25c7857b23eac69df4d).
