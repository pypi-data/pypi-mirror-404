# A JAX-Accelerated Stellar Stream Generator

StreaMAX is a lightweight, high-performance simulator for stellar streams built with JAX.  
It’s designed to make modeling and inference on stellar streams fast enough for Bayesian analysis and modern data-intensive workflows.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Particle-spray modeling of stellar streams  
- Fast 2D track extraction  
- JAX-accelerated integration for GPU/TPU compatibility  
- Automatic differentiation, can easily compute gradients of the models directly via JAX  
- Modular architecture

---

## 🧩 Models

StreaMAX supports:
- Rapid generation of stellar streams using the particle-spray method  
- Efficient extraction of stream tracks for analysis and inference  

---

## 🧪 Quick Start

See the `quick_start.ipynb` notebook for an example on how to:

- Define potential and stream parameters  
- Generate a stream using the particle-spray method  
- Extract and visualize the resulting track
