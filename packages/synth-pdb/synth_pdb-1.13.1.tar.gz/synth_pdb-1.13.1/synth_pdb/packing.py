    # We could try every combination, but that's impossible (Combinatorial Explosion).
    # Instead, we use "Monte Carlo" simulation:
    # 1. Make a random change (like rotating a side chain).
    # 2. Measure the energy (Clash Score).
    # 3. If energy is lower (better), ACCEPT the move.
    # 4. If energy is higher (worse), we might still accept it based on probability.
    #
    # Why accept a worse state? To escape "Local Minima".
    # Imagine being stuck in a small pothole while trying to reach the bottom of the Grand Canyon.
    # You need to climb UP out of the pothole to go down further.
