Tests for disulfide bond (SSBOND) detection and annotation.

EDUCATIONAL NOTE - Disulfide Bonds in Proteins
==============================================
Disulfide bonds (also called disulfide bridges) are covalent bonds between
two cysteine residues in a protein.

What are Disulfide Bonds?
- Covalent S-S bond between sulfur atoms of two cysteines
- Form when two CYS side chains come close together
- Typical SG-SG distance: 2.0-2.1 Å
- One of the strongest bonds in proteins

How They Form:
1. Two cysteine residues come close in 3D space
2. Oxidation reaction occurs (requires oxidizing environment)
3. Sulfur atoms (SG) form covalent S-S bond
4. Two hydrogen atoms are removed (oxidation)

Chemical Reaction:
2 Cys-SH → Cys-S-S-Cys + 2H+ + 2e-

Why They're Important:
1. **Protein Stability**: Stabilize folded structure
2. **Extracellular Proteins**: Common in proteins outside cells
3. **Protein Folding**: Guide and constrain folding pathways
4. **Redox Regulation**: Can be formed/broken to regulate activity

Where They Occur:
- Extracellular proteins (oxidizing environment)
- Secreted proteins (antibodies, hormones, enzymes)
- Rare in cytoplasm (reducing environment prevents formation)

In PDB Files:
- Annotated with SSBOND records in header
- Format: SSBOND   1 CYS A    6    CYS A   11
- Indicates which CYS residues are bonded
- Helps understand protein structure and stability

Educational Impact:
Understanding disulfide bonds teaches:
1. Post-translational modifications
2. Protein stability mechanisms
3. Relationship between sequence and structure
4. Importance of cellular environment (oxidizing vs reducing)

        Test that close cysteine pairs are detected as disulfide bonds.
        
        EDUCATIONAL NOTE - Distance Criteria:
        Disulfide bonds have very specific geometry:
        - SG-SG distance: 2.0-2.1 Å (very consistent)
        - S-S-Cα angle: ~103°
        - Dihedral angles: specific preferences
        
        For detection, we primarily use distance:
        - < 2.0 Å: Too close (steric clash)
        - 2.0-2.1 Å: Typical disulfide bond
        - > 2.1 Å: Too far (no bond)
        
        We use a slightly relaxed criterion (2.0-2.2 Å) to account for:
        - Structural flexibility
        - Coordinate precision
        - Different oxidation states
