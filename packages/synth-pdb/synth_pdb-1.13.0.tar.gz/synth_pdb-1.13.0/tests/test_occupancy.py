Tests for occupancy value assignment.

EDUCATIONAL NOTE - What is Occupancy?
=====================================
Occupancy (columns 55-60 in PDB ATOM records) represents the fraction of 
molecules in a crystal where an atom occupies a particular position.

Physical Meaning:
- 1.00 = Atom present in 100% of molecules (fully ordered)
- 0.85 = Atom present in 85% of molecules (some disorder)
- 0.50 = Two equally populated alternate conformations
- <0.50 = Highly disordered or multiple conformations

Why Occupancy Varies:
1. **Conformational Flexibility**: Flexible regions (loops, termini) show disorder
2. **Alternate Conformations**: Side chains can adopt multiple rotamers
3. **Crystal Packing**: Surface residues may be less ordered
4. **Temperature**: Higher temperature increases disorder

Relationship to B-factors:
- Both indicate atomic disorder
- Low occupancy often correlates with high B-factors
- Occupancy = static disorder (multiple positions)
- B-factor = dynamic disorder (thermal motion)

In Real Structures:
- Core residues: occupancy ≈ 1.00 (well-ordered)
- Surface residues: occupancy 0.90-1.00 (some disorder)
- Flexible loops: occupancy 0.85-0.95 (disordered)
- Alternate conformations: occupancy 0.40-0.60 each (split)
