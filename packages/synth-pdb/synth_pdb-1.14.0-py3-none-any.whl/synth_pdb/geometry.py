    # -----------------------------------------------------------------
    # Most protein structures are natively defined by their "Internal Coordinates" 
    # (Z-Matrix): Bond Lengths, Bond Angles, and Torsion/Dihedral Angles.
    # 
    # To convert these into 3D Cartesian coordinates (X, Y, Z), we use the 
    # "NeRF" method (Parsons et al., J. Comput. Chem. 2005). 
    #
    # How it works:
    # 1. We define a local coordinate system based on three previous atoms (P1, P2, P3).
    # 2. P3 is the origin (0, 0, 0).
    # 3. The axis b = (P3 - P2) is the primary direction.
    # 4. We use Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to define the Plane Normal (c) and 
    #    the In-Plane Normal (d).
    # 5. The new atom P4 is then "placed" in this local frame using spherical-to-Cartesian 
    #    conversion and then transformed back into the global reference frame.

    # EDUCATIONAL NOTE - Circular Statistics (The 180/-180 Problem):
    # -----------------------------------------------------------
    # In protein geometry, torsion angles (Phi, Psi, Omega, Chi) are periodic. 
    # This introduces a challenge for both math and AI modeling:
    # 
    # 1. The Boundary Artifact: An angle of -179 deg is physically very close to 
    #    +179 deg, but their arithmetic difference is 358 deg. 
    # 2. Correct Distance: To find the "real" difference between two angles, we 
    #    must use: `diff = (a - b + 180) % 360 - 180`.
    # 3. AI Loss Functions: Naive Mean Squared Error (MSE) fails on angles because 
    #    it doesn't understand this wrapping. High-performance models (like 
    #    AlphaFold) often predict the (Sine, Cosine) of the angle instead, 
    #    ensuring a smooth, continuous coordinate space.
    # 4. Phase Wrapping: In structure generation, "Drift" must be applied carefully
    #    to avoid discontinuities at the -180/180 boundary.

        #  did it include CD/CE? Yes, it superimposed the *entire* `ref_res_template`.

        # ERROR FOUND in existing code!
        # The current `generator.py` breaks sidechain geometry for anything longer than Valine/Serine if it applies a rotamer.
