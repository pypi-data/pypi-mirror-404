THE "AI TRINITY" PART 3: Spatial Relationships.

Why Distance Matrices?
----------------------
In the world of Protein AI (like AlphaFold), the **Coordinate System** (X, Y, Z) is often discarded because it depends on rotation and translation. Two identical proteins rotated by 90 degrees have different coordinates but the same shape.

The **Distance Matrix** is **Rotation-Invariant**. If you calculate the distance between every pair of residues ($d_{ij}$), this matrix $D$ is identical regardless of how you rotate the protein.

$D_{ij} = ||r_i - r_j||$

This matrix contains all the information needed to reconstruct the 3D shape (up to mirror symmetry). It is the fundamental "image" of a protein that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers operate on.
