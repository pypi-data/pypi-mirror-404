# Version v0.1.58

This release focuses on improving the canvas rendering robustness, enhancing testing infrastructure, updating documentation for better clarity and contribution guidelines, and temporarily disabling the multiplayer UI.

## New Features

- Implemented defensive edge rendering in the canvas to handle asynchronous node rendering, preventing missing nodes from causing silent failures by deferring edge rendering until nodes are available. Added extensive unit and integration tests to verify this behavior. (5477ee) (Eric Ma)
- Centralized and improved assertion helpers in tests to reduce duplication and increase maintainability. (dc883a, 0e1887, a86c98) (Eric Ma)
- Updated PR description guidelines in AGENTS.md with a detailed template and best practices to improve contribution quality and clarity. (e41942) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed canvas rendering issue where committee response nodes did not appear until page refresh due to race conditions between async node rendering and synchronous edge addition. (5477ee) (Eric Ma)
- Corrected formatting issues in the v0.1.57 release notes and improved readability in AGENTS.md documentation. (b929a2) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- Disabled the multiplayer UI temporarily. (3e380f) (Eric Ma)
