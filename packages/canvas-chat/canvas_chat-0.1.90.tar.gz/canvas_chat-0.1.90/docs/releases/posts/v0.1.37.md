# Version 0.1.37

This release focuses on enhancing the user experience during package installation and code execution. It introduces smooth, real-time installation progress updates within an output drawer, improves UI responsiveness by eliminating blocking animations, and adds AI-augmented code generation with DataFrame introspection. Additionally, Pyodide is preloaded for faster execution, and various fixes improve canvas interaction and drawer behavior.

## New Features

- Show installation progress in the output drawer with smooth animations, including auto-expand/collapse and dedicated styling for progress messages (d32a87) (Eric Ma)
- Surface package installation progress in real-time within code nodes, showing which packages are being installed and from which source (4520c4) (Eric Ma)
- Improve package installation with better error handling, clearer feedback, and emoji indicators for progress (c551db) (Eric Ma)
- Add AI-augmented code generation with DataFrame introspection, including a new /code command, inline AI button, CodeMirror editor, and streaming code generation support (e185a9) (Eric Ma)
- Preload Pyodide runtime when code nodes are created to speed up execution, with loading state tracking and UI updates (40c846) (Eric Ma)
- Add CSV upload and Python code execution with Pyodide, including drag & drop CSV parsing, new node types, and automatic package installation (f4d16e) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Fix drawer animation to skip redundant animations on re-render and improve browser yielding for smoother UI updates (64fc34) (Eric Ma)
- Keep drawer open after installation completes and preserve install progress messages for better user visibility (763111) (Eric Ma)
- Allow canvas interaction such as pan and zoom during package installation by yielding to the browser event loop (75206e) (Eric Ma)
- Simplify drawer behavior by removing blocking animations and freezing, enabling smooth updates and interaction (682a0a) (Eric Ma)
- Eliminate drawer flickering during package installation by updating content without full re-renders (5f3d25) (Eric Ma)
- Prevent canvas panning when scrolling inside the CodeMirror editor to improve user experience (bbd119) (Eric Ma)
- Fix /code command to create standalone code nodes without requiring CSV input (436fdde) (Eric Ma)
- Replace non-existent findNonOverlappingPosition method with autoPosition for positioning logic (833cf0a) (Eric Ma)
- Remove redundant matplotlib-specific installation logic to simplify package handling (0fe8267) (Eric Ma)
