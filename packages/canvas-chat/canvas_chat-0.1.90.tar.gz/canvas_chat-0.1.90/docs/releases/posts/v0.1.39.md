# Version 0.1.39

This release introduces a new DuckDuckGo fallback for the research command, adds stop and continue controls for research nodes, and improves documentation and tests to reflect recent changes.

## New Features

- Added a DuckDuckGo fallback search option for the /research command, enabling iterative search loops with parallel fetching, relevance filtering, retry logic, and error handling. The frontend now automatically uses this fallback when the Exa API key is missing, and the provider is shown in the slash command autocomplete. (4e3f13) (Eric Ma)
- Added STOP and CONTINUE buttons to research nodes, allowing users to stop and resume research. The model used is displayed in the research node header, and the continue functionality restarts research on the same node using stored original instructions and context. (10474a) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed the DDGResearchRequest test to correctly reflect that the api_key field is optional, ensuring only instructions and model are required. (50c9a0) (Eric Ma)
- Updated deep-research documentation formatting to comply with markdownlint and corrected information to indicate that research can now be stopped and resumed, removing outdated statements. (393cde) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- None in this release.
