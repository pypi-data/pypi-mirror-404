# Version 0.1.4

This version improves the user experience of the layout view by maintaining the current viewport, adding helpful hints, and enabling easier navigation when zoomed out.

## New Features

- The layout view no longer auto-zooms to fit content, preserving the current viewport for better user control (7e2e87) (Eric Ma)
- A hint overlay is shown when nodes exist but none are visible in the viewport, helping users understand the layout state (7e2e87) (Eric Ma)
- Users can drag nodes from anywhere when zoomed out (scale ≤ 0.6), improving navigation and interaction (7e2e87) (Eric Ma)
- Added a codebase map to AGENTS.md to facilitate easier navigation of the project (7e2e87) (Eric Ma)
