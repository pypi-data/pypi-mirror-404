# Version v0.1.80

This release focuses on improving the matrix plugin by fully encapsulating undo/redo logic within the plugin architecture, enhancing test coverage with new end-to-end tests, and refactoring clipboard copy functionality to be self-contained. Additionally, it introduces better plugin support for custom undo/redo handlers and improves test reliability and documentation.

## New Features

- Added plugin action handler registration to the undo manager, allowing plugins to own their undo/redo logic and handlers, with full integration in the matrix plugin (0be33c) (Eric Ma)
- Added Cypress end-to-end tests for the matrix copy-to-clipboard keyboard shortcut, verifying copy functionality and guard conditions (2544a6) (Eric Ma)
- Documented Cypress E2E test files and running patterns for UI and keyboard interaction testing in AGENTS.md (19ced7) (Eric Ma)
- Refactored matrix undo/redo Cypress tests for improved determinism and reliability by mocking APIs and simplifying test cases (7c16e0) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Added Ollama health check step in the Cypress AI workflow to prevent test timeouts caused by service unavailability (0be33c7) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- Removed matrix undo/redo logic from the core app.js, fully migrating it to the matrix plugin to follow plugin architecture principles (d643a1) (Eric Ma)
- Removed legacy streamingMatrixCells state and external clipboard formatting utilities, replacing them with self-contained methods in the MatrixNode class (eaf6a8) (Eric Ma)
