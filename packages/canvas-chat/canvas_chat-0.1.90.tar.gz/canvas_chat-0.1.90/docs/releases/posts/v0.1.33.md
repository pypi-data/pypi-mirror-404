# Version 0.1.33

This release introduces improved navigation shortcuts and a major enhancement to node management with collapsible child nodes for better canvas organization. It also includes new unit tests and code cleanup for more reliable and maintainable graph operations.

## New Features

- Added j/k keyboard shortcuts to navigate parent and child nodes intuitively, improving user navigation both in the main view and popover selections. The help modal was updated to document these new shortcuts. (d30ef5) (Eric Ma)
- Introduced collapsible child nodes with collapse/expand buttons on all node types, enabling users to clean up the canvas view. This feature persists collapsed states across page reloads and correctly handles merge nodes visibility. (c084d0) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Added unit tests for collapse graph methods and removed debug logging to improve code quality and maintainability. Also cleaned up node visibility logic. (45ba38) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- No deprecations in this release.
