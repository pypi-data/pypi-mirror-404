# Version 0.1.21

This release improves node selection behavior, enhances Matrix and PDF node interfaces, fixes navigation issues, and updates the development environment configuration.

## New Features

- Added a Summarize button to PDF nodes to enable document summarization directly from the node interface (5aa312) (Eric Ma)
- Unified Matrix node rendering to follow the standard header/content/footer structure for consistent UI and easier maintenance (dad3c4) (Eric Ma)
- Added navigation buttons to Matrix nodes dynamically, ensuring consistency with other node types (8aafe2) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed node selection to use the capture phase, allowing any click inside a node to select it regardless of which child element handles the click (8c18ba) (Eric Ma)
- Fixed duplicate parent/child entries in the navigation popover by removing redundant index updates (5aa312) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- Removed the special case handling for Matrix nodes in canvas.js in favor of a unified rendering approach (dad3c4) (Eric Ma)
