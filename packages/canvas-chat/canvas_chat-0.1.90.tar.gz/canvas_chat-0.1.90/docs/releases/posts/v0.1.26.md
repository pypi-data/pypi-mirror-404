# Version 0.1.26

This release introduces support for user-defined custom models compatible with LiteLLM, allowing users to add and manage their own model IDs with optional base URLs. It also improves the release process by preventing trailing whitespace and stale lock files, and refactors release formatting to use pre-commit hooks for better consistency.

- Add support for user-defined custom models that persist in settings and appear in the model picker, with optional per-model base URL configuration (d1b19b) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes
