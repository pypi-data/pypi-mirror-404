# Version 0.1.31

This release focuses on improving code quality and maintainability by introducing a new helper method to prevent bugs, enhancing documentation on testing best practices, fixing critical bugs related to API calls, and cleaning up code formatting.

## New Features

- Added a `buildLLMRequest` helper method in the App class to centralize and standardize parameters for LLM API requests, preventing missing `base_url` bugs and reducing code duplication (f4b362) (Eric Ma)
- Added a new section "When NOT to write unit tests" in AGENTS.md to guide developers on appropriate testing strategies and avoid brittle or redundant tests (c30913) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed missing `base_url` parameter in all `/api/refine-query` calls (search, research, factcheck), ensuring correct routing through LLM proxy configurations (36bdd0) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- Removed 7 unit tests for the `buildLLMRequest` helper after code review, following updated testing guidelines that discourage unit testing complex instance methods with runtime dependencies (a95a93) (Eric Ma)

## Chores

- Applied pre-commit formatting fixes including markdown improvements and removal of unused imports to maintain code quality (abe8fc) (Eric Ma)
