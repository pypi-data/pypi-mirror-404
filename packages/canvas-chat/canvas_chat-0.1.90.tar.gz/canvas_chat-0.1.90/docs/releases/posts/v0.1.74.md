# Version 0.1.74

This release focuses on improving the reliability of event handling in collaborative graph sessions and clarifies the project's merge strategy for better development practices.

## New Features

- Added documentation specifying that pull requests should be merged using the default merge strategy (not --squash) to preserve commit history for debugging and attribution. (c4dacf, Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where graph event listeners were not re-attached when creating new sessions, which previously caused the "New Canvas" bug. Refactored event listener setup into a dedicated method and added both static and runtime regression tests to prevent this bug from recurring. (aeeec2, Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- None in this release.
