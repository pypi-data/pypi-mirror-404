# Version 0.1.2

This release introduces a powerful new feature called the LLM Committee, enabling multi-model consultation with parallel querying, peer review, and synthesized responses. It also includes retroactive release notes for previous versions and improvements to the release note generation process.

## New Features

- Implemented the LLM Committee feature that allows querying multiple language models simultaneously, includes a peer review stage where models critique each other, and synthesizes the final response via a chairman model. This includes backend SSE endpoint, frontend modal for model selection, and streaming UI with stop controls. (f46fdf) (Eric Ma)
- Added retroactive release notes for versions 0.1.0 and 0.1.1 to improve documentation and changelog completeness. (38bb01) (Eric Ma)
- Integrated LLM-generated release notes using llamabot in the auto-release workflow, automating the generation and storage of release notes for future versions. (357656) (Eric Ma)
