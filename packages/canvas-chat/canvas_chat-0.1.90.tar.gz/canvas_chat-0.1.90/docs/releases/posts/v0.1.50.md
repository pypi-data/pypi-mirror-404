# Version 0.1.49

This release improves the AI code generation feature by ensuring that content from PDF nodes is properly included in the context sent to the language model. This results in more accurate and relevant code generation based on the content of PDF documents. Additionally, backend limits on message size and count have been removed to accommodate large PDF content.

## New Features

- Added test coverage to verify PDF nodes are included in code generation context with correct role mapping (1fb473) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Include PDF node content in the code generation context by updating ancestor context filters on the frontend and removing message truncation and limits on the backend (1fb473) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- None
