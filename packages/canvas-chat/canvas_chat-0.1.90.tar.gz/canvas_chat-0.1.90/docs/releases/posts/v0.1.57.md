# Version v0.1.57

This release focuses on improving edge rendering accuracy by ensuring fresh node positions are used after asynchronous operations, introduces a full persona-based committee feature with UI and data layer support, and updates the continuous integration workflows and dependencies for better automation and stability.

## New Features

- Add persona support to the committee data layer, injecting personas as system prompts and displaying persona labels in opinion nodes (58935e) (Eric Ma)
- Complete the persona-based committee UI with dynamic member lists, persona suggestions, add/remove functionality, and validation (7f1cc5) (Eric Ma)
- Add comprehensive persona feature tests covering injection, UI behavior, and data validation (fffdbd) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Fix edge rendering bugs by switching to event-driven rendering and always using fresh node positions to prevent stale visuals after layout changes or async operations (09e2d2) (Eric Ma)
- Correct synthesis edge rendering to use current node positions when Force Directed layout is applied during opinion generation (c46705) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- None in this release.

## Maintenance

- Update auto-release workflow to streamline pre-commit usage and staging logic; update jaraco-context dependency and mark a package as editable for development (7adf70) (Eric Ma)
- Bump GitHub Actions dependencies: actions/cache from v4 to v5 and actions/upload-pages-artifact from v3 to v4 for improved CI performance and security (5ee86f, 5e5de8) (dependabot[bot])
