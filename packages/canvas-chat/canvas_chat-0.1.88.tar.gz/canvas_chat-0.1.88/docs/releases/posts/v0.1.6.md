# Version 0.1.6

This release improves the handling and visibility of tags across all node types, ensuring consistent rendering and better user experience. It also includes detailed documentation to help future contributors understand the node tags architecture.

## New Features

- Documented the node tags architecture with guidance on rendering, CSS considerations, and adding new node types (b6fc56) (Eric Ma)
- Refactored tags to be a fundamental property of all nodes by rendering them centrally in `renderNode()`, preventing accidental omission in new node types (81b0e3) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed tag visibility issues by removing `overflow:hidden` from node containers, allowing tags positioned outside node boundaries to be fully visible (2916df) (Eric Ma)
- Ensured tags remain visible at all zoom levels and added missing tag rendering for Matrix nodes (ecdd52) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- None
