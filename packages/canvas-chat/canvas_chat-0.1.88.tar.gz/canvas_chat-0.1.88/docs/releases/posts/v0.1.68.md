# Version v0.1.68

This release introduces a new feature flag to control GitHub Copilot integration in the chat, enhancing security and configurability. It also improves environment variable management by using secrets, adds documentation to prevent direct deployment to Modal, and fixes a test related to model loading.

## New Features

- Add a feature flag `CANVAS_CHAT_ENABLE_GITHUB_COPILOT` to enable or disable GitHub Copilot in the chat, including backend checks, frontend UI updates, and API support for feature flags (7e573f) (Eric Ma)
- Use `modal.Secret` for managing the `CANVAS_CHAT_ENABLE_GITHUB_COPILOT` environment variable to improve security and manageability over `.env()` usage (d59e45) (Eric Ma)
- Add a rule in documentation to never deploy directly to Modal, improving deployment safety (e83b9c) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Fix test setup by correctly setting `copilotEnabled` to ensure the `loadModels` test passes (40d1b7) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- None
