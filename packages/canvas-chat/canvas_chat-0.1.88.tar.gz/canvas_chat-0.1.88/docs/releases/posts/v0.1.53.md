# Version 0.1.52

This release includes important bug fixes to improve the user interface during auto-layout animations and enhancements to the documentation deployment process to ensure more reliable and timely updates.

## New Features

- Added comprehensive regression tests to ensure output panels stay attached to their parent nodes during layout animations (3be0db) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed output drawer panels staying detached during auto-layout animations by updating their positions alongside parent nodes (3be0db) (Eric Ma)
- Changed documentation deployment to use a scheduled daily run instead of a workflow trigger, avoiding GitHub token permission issues and ensuring docs are published within 24 hours of a release (e44b09) (Eric Ma)
- Updated docs workflow to use a Personal Access Token (PAT) for automatic triggering, replacing the broken GitHub token trigger and improving automation reliability (2cc1e2) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- Removed the broken 'gh workflow run' step from the auto-release process due to GitHub token restrictions (e44b09) (Eric Ma)
