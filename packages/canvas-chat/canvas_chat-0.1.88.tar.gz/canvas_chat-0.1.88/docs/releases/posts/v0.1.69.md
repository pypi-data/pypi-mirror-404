# Version v0.1.69

This release introduces comprehensive TypeScript type checking to the JavaScript codebase, improving code quality and developer experience. It includes tooling, documentation, and incremental migration guidance to facilitate a smooth transition towards stronger typing.

## New Features

- Added TypeScript as a development dependency and enabled strict type checking on JavaScript files using the `checkJs` option in `tsconfig.json`. This ensures better type safety without fully converting files to TypeScript. (26cfcb) (github-actions)
- Introduced npm and pixi scripts (`npm run typecheck`, `pixi run typecheck`) to run the type checking process easily from the command line. (26cfcb) (github-actions)
- Documented the type checking workflow, annotation patterns, and recommended migration order in `AGENTS.md` to guide contributors on incrementally migrating JavaScript files to TypeScript. (296fa9) (Eric Ma)
- Added JSDoc type annotations to `layout.js` to improve type safety and IDE support while maintaining JavaScript syntax. (26cfcb) (github-actions)
- Updated tests to use node objects with `id` fields, aligning with the new type definitions for consistency. (26cfcb) (github-actions)
