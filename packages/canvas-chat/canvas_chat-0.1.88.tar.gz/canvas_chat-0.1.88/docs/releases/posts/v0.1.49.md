# Version 0.1.48

This release improves the release notes management by migrating to a blog plugin for better organization and navigation. It also enhances the code-style workflow performance with caching, fixes a loading race condition in the SlashCommandMenu, and keeps dependency lock files in sync during releases.

## New Features

- Migrated release notes to use the MkDocs Material blog plugin, enabling auto-generated indexes, archive pages, pagination, and clean URLs for easier browsing of release history (6171fc) (Eric Ma)
- Added caching to pre-commit hooks in the code-style workflow to speed up CI runs by avoiding reinstalling unchanged hooks (fed1df) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a race condition causing the SlashCommandMenu to fail loading on first access by adding an explicit script tag; also ensured pixi.lock is synchronized with pyproject.toml during auto-release (681d5f) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- None
