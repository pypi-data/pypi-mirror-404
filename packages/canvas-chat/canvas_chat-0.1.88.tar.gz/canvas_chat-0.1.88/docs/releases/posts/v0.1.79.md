# Version v0.1.79

This release focuses on improving the matrix plugin's undo/redo functionality by fully encapsulating its logic within the plugin architecture. It introduces a new plugin action handler registration mechanism in the UndoManager, refactors matrix undo/redo handling to use this mechanism, and enhances test reliability and determinism. Additionally, a fix was made to the Cypress AI workflow to ensure Ollama service readiness and prevent test timeouts.

## New Features

- Added plugin action handler registration to the UndoManager, allowing plugins to register and manage their own undo/redo handlers, and updated the MatrixFeature to use this mechanism directly for undo actions (760968) (Eric Ma)
- Refactored matrix undo/redo logic by moving it from app.js into the matrix plugin, including new undo/redo handlers, removal of matrix-specific cases from core app code, added unit and Cypress tests, and updated documentation to reflect the plugin-based undo/redo pattern (73c30e) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed Cypress AI workflow by adding an explicit health check for Ollama before pulling the model, preventing test timeouts due to Ollama service unavailability (eb952c) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- Removed matrix undo/redo handling from app.js, delegating all related logic to the matrix plugin to follow the plugin architecture principle (73c30e) (Eric Ma)
