# Version 0.1.24

This version introduces a new interactive feature that allows users to highlight nodes by their tags, improving the ability to visually filter and explore tagged elements within the interface.

## New Features

- Added the ability to highlight all nodes sharing a tag by clicking on tag chips. Non-matching nodes and their edges fade out, while matching nodes receive a highlight ring. Clicking the same tag again or the canvas background clears the highlight. The tag drawer also supports highlighting when no nodes are selected and shows a magnifying glass icon on the active filter in the tag drawer (c20793) (Eric Ma)
