# Version 0.1.3

This release introduces a new slash command to create standalone markdown notes, allowing users to paste content such as papers or notes without triggering an AI response. These notes can be edited and used as context for branching questions.

## New Features

- Added the /note command to create standalone NOTE nodes for markdown content, which do not auto-attach to existing nodes and have a 4:3 aspect ratio with scrollable content. An edit button is also enabled for modifying note content (41d3e8) (Eric Ma)
