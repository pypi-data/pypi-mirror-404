# Version 0.1.43

This release introduces enhanced flexibility for configuring endpoints in admin mode by allowing environment variable-based settings. This change simplifies managing different environments such as development, testing, and production without modifying the configuration file.

## New Features

- Support endpoint configuration via environment variables in admin mode, enabling the same config.yaml to be used across dev/test/prod environments by setting different endpoint values through environment variables (dd504a) (Eric Ma)
