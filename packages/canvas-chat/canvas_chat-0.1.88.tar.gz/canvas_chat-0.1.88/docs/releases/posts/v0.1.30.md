# Version 0.1.30

This release improves the robustness of text highlighting in markdown tables containing rendered math by replacing the previous normalization-based matching with a Smith-Waterman local alignment algorithm. This change addresses issues with incorrect or partial highlights caused by browser artifacts when selecting text from KaTeX-rendered content.

## New Features

- Implement Smith-Waterman local alignment to accurately match user text selections in HTML, handling insertions, deletions, and mismatches gracefully (064e70) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Fix text highlighting failures in KaTeX-rendered markdown tables by replacing normalization-based matching with sequence alignment (064e70) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- None
