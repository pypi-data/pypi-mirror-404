# How to navigate between connected nodes

Canvas Chat allows you to quickly move between parent and child nodes
using keyboard shortcuts or navigation buttons.

## Using keyboard shortcuts

When a node is selected:

1. Press **Arrow Up** to navigate to a parent node
2. Press **Arrow Down** to navigate to a child node

### Single connection

If there's only one parent or child, you'll navigate directly to that node.

### Multiple connections

If there are multiple parents or children, a selection menu appears:

1. Use **Arrow Up/Down** to highlight different options
2. Press **Enter** to navigate to the highlighted node
3. Press **Esc** to close the menu without navigating

### No connections

If the node has no parents (root node) or no children (leaf node),
a brief message appears indicating there are no nodes to navigate to.

## Using navigation buttons

You can also use the mouse:

1. Hover over a node to reveal the navigation buttons (↑ ↓) in the header
2. Click **↑** to go to parent(s) or **↓** to go to child(ren)
3. If multiple connections exist, click an option from the menu

## Tips

- **Quick traversal**: Press Arrow Down repeatedly to walk down a conversation thread
- **Backtracking**: Press Arrow Up to go back up the conversation tree
- **Works with selection**: After navigating, press `R` to reply to the new node
