# Version 0.1.13

This release improves the math rendering capabilities in markdown by switching to a more robust approach using KaTeX directly. It fixes issues with math delimiters being altered during markdown processing and enhances debugging and configuration for consistent math display across all node types. Documentation has also been updated to reflect these improvements.

## New Features

- Add LaTeX math rendering support with KaTeX, supporting multiple math delimiters and automatic rendering in all node types (7f8fc6) (Eric Ma)
- Add documentation for math rendering support in README and PDF import docs (b357cf) (Eric Ma)
- Add debug logging to help diagnose math rendering issues (3d822c) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Fix math rendering by using HTML comment placeholders instead of underscores to prevent markdown formatting issues (ecf402) (Eric Ma)
- Fix math rendering by protecting math delimiters from markdown backslash escaping (743912) (Eric Ma)
