# Version 0.1.23

This release introduces a new feature that allows users to resize the index column in matrix nodes by dragging the corner cell's right edge. The chosen width is saved and restored on re-render. Additionally, unit tests have been added to ensure this functionality works correctly. Documentation has also been updated to clarify the branching strategy for contributing to the project.
