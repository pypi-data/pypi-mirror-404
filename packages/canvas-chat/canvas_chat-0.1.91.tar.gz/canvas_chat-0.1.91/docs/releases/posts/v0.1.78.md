# Version v0.1.78

This release introduces comprehensive end-to-end testing for matrix creation and AI chat features using Cypress, along with significant improvements to the Cypress CI workflow and test infrastructure. The matrix functionality code has been refactored for better modularity and maintainability by moving it into a dedicated plugin. Several fixes enhance the reliability of the CI environment, including improved server readiness checks and streamlined dev server management. Additionally, numerous new Cypress test suites have been added to cover UI interactions such as undo/redo, settings modal, help modal, auto-layout, keyboard shortcuts, and canvas clearing, achieving full test coverage for core features.

## New Features

- Added comprehensive Cypress end-to-end tests for matrix creation, including UI interactions and semantic zoom behavior, using Ollama LLM calls tagged with @ai (c8d8ef) (Eric Ma)
- Added Cypress E2E tests for AI chat interactions with Ollama gemma3n:e4b model, including multi-turn conversations and streaming (d3cb61) (Eric Ma)
- Added Cypress test suites for undo/redo functionality, settings modal, help modal, auto-layout button, keyboard interactions (Enter and Shift+Enter), and new canvas clearing (f49be1, d81072, ea15bf, a2ced4, a842dc4, 388d18a) (Eric Ma)
- Established Cypress E2E testing infrastructure with GitHub Actions workflow, localStorage and IndexedDB clearing, and basic canvas interaction tests (cba03a) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Refactored matrix-specific code from app.js into MatrixFeature plugin to eliminate duplication and improve separation of concerns (c14869) (Eric Ma)
- Fixed Cypress CI failures by replacing fixed sleep with dynamic server health check, ensuring server readiness before tests run (f49be1) (Eric Ma)
- Fixed Cypress CI by letting Cypress action manage dev server lifecycle, preventing premature server termination (b5e76e) (Eric Ma)
- Fixed pixi installation in CI by switching to official GitHub Action, improving reliability (2af8344) (Eric Ma)
- Fixed Cypress test selectors and interaction issues for stable test execution (6294ef2) (Eric Ma)
- Updated Cypress workflow to specify explicit test spec files instead of config patterns, ensuring correct test execution (e77555) (Eric Ma)
- Updated Cypress tests to use new Ollama model gemma3n:e4b for CI consistency (0694c6) (Eric Ma)
- Improved Cypress workflow Docker setup by mounting Ollama volume and switching model pull to HTTP API (244f49) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- Removed duplicate and unnecessary matrix formatting code from app.js and canvas.js in favor of utility imports (c14869) (Eric Ma)
