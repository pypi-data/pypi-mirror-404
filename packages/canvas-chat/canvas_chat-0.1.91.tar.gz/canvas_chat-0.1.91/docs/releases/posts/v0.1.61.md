# Version v0.1.61

This release introduces significant improvements to plugin architecture, including the addition of standalone YouTube and GitRepo plugins with dedicated slash commands. YouTube video embedding and transcript handling have been enhanced for better user experience. The CRDT graph now supports generic recursive conversion for nested plugin data, improving data persistence. URL fetching has been refactored for unified backend routing and clearer separation of concerns. Several bug fixes improve metadata handling, output panel rendering, and file selection UX. Documentation and tests have been updated to reflect these changes.

## New Features

- Added YouTube and GitRepo as standalone plugins with `/youtube` and `/git` slash commands, including new node types and simplified URL fetching (1dc43b) (Eric Ma)
- Added generic recursive conversion for plugin-specific nested objects in CRDT graph to support deeply nested data structures (534f55) (Eric Ma)
- Added YouTube video embedding to fetch result nodes with responsive iframe and flip button for transcript viewing (40643e) (Eric Ma)
- Created new `/fetch` command for URL fetching, separating it from `/note` command to clarify plugin responsibilities (9d0969) (Eric Ma)
- Improved YouTube node rendering and UX by embedding video in main content and showing transcript in output panel (4290a9) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed metadata passing and storage to ensure YouTube video embedding works correctly, including storing metadata as Y.Map in CRDT graph (51933a, 4965f8) (Eric Ma)
- Restored smooth drawer animation and preserved scroll position when selecting files in GitRepo plugin (e5fdac) (Eric Ma)
- Removed file size limits and improved file selection UX in GitRepo plugin with clear visual distinctions (8f20bb) (Eric Ma)
- Fixed GitRepoProtocol to properly handle YouTube videos and delegate non-git repo content to parent protocol (9b0d7f, fb4a77) (Eric Ma)
- Prevented arxiv.org and similar URLs from being incorrectly detected as git repositories by refining URL patterns and adding exclusions (a77c01) (Eric Ma)
- Fixed YouTube transcript API usage to be compatible with version 1.2.3 and updated dependencies accordingly (e5bcad, 72f665) (Eric Ma)
- Fixed output panel rendering for YouTube videos by ensuring node updates before re-render and deferring rendering until graph update completes (a5fea7, 71bc36, c95143) (Eric Ma)
- Fixed backend URL fetch endpoint to pass metadata dict instead of old video_id format (51933a) (Eric Ma)
- Fixed handlers to accept additional parameters via **kwargs to avoid TypeErrors in GitRepo handler (caeb87) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- Renamed RESUMMARIZE action to SUMMARIZE throughout the codebase for clarity and consistency (8c7f3d) (Eric Ma)
