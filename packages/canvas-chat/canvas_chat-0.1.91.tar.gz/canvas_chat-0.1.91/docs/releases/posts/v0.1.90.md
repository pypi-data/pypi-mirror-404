# Version v0.1.90

This release introduces a new factcheck claim review modal to enhance content verification workflows. Factcheck nodes are now non-editable to prevent unintended modifications, improving data integrity. Additionally, the canvas rendering has been fixed to properly clear edges when nodes are removed, ensuring a cleaner user interface. The release also includes expanded test coverage for the factcheck modal to improve reliability.
