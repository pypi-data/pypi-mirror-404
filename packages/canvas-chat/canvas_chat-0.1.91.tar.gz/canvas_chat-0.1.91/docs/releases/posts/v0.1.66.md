# Version v0.1.66

This release focuses on improving the plugin architecture by refactoring model-related utilities into a dedicated module. This change enhances code modularity and separation of concerns, making it easier for plugins to reuse model utilities without depending on the chat module. Additionally, some cleanup was performed by removing an obsolete test file.

## New Features

- Extracted model utility functions (getApiKeyForModel and getBaseUrlForModel) into a new module `model-utils.js` to improve plugin reusability and separation of concerns (5945cd) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Removed leftover test file `test-expire-auth.js` that was no longer needed after debugging (5945cd) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- None
