# Version 0.1.54

This release focuses on fixing a critical bug related to edge positioning during node resizing, improving test coverage to prevent regressions, and updating dependencies.

## New Features

- Added comprehensive regression tests to ensure edge positions remain stable when nodes are resized or moved, including multiple edges and floating point tolerance comparisons (df182a) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed edge position jumps during node resize by ensuring the current node position is read from the DOM wrapper instead of using stale cached data, preventing edges from snapping incorrectly (df182a) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- None
