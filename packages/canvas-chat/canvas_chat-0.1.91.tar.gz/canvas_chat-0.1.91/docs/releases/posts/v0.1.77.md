# Version v0.1.77

This release introduces support for Ollama image generation with local models, enhanced test coverage, improved documentation and JSDoc usage, and various code style and import fixes. It also refines the pre-commit hooks and clarifies type checking practices in the project.

## New Features

- Add support for generating images using local Ollama models via the `/image` slash command, including direct API calls, streaming JSON response parsing, and frontend model selector integration (b9ed67) (Eric Ma)
- Add property-based unit tests and integration tests for Ollama image generation feature, including reusable fixtures and API contract validation (0d999a) (Eric Ma)
- Add `.jsdoc.json` configuration file for JSDoc linter to enable new pre-commit hook (09a72b) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Fix incorrect import path for `AppContext` in image-generation plugin (e2f576) (Eric Ma)
- Resolve multiple TypeScript errors in `image-generation.js` by fixing imports, removing incompatible type assertions, and cleaning up JSDoc comments (17e591) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- Remove TypeScript type checking and JSDoc linter from pre-commit hooks and pixi tasks, leaving only JSDoc documentation generation (fc48a9) (Eric Ma)
