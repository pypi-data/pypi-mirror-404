# Version v0.1.60

This release introduces a fully self-contained Git repository plugin with private repository support and credential management, significantly enhancing how git repo nodes are handled. The plugin architecture continues to mature with comprehensive plugin-ification of node types and features, improved keyboard shortcut handling, and expanded plugin-scoped event handling. Additionally, the release includes numerous bug fixes, UI improvements, and extensive documentation and testing enhancements.

## New Features

- Added a self-contained Git repository plugin with interactive file selection, file tree rendering, and support for private repositories via credential management, including UI integration and backend API updates (30babc) (Eric Ma)
- Plugin-ified keyboard shortcuts and action buttons with protocol-based dispatch and customizable node actions, improving extensibility and user interaction (a5f63c) (Eric Ma)
- Made the Edit button on git repo nodes open a file selection modal that pre-selects fetched files and updates nodes on save, streamlining editing workflows (4318bc) (Eric Ma)
- Added plugin-scoped canvas event handlers and implemented a comprehensive poll feature plugin demonstrating plugin-scoped event handling, streaming LLM generation, and slash command integration (aa54ea) (Eric Ma)
- Converted numerous node types (AINode, HumanNode, OpinionNode, ResearchNode, PdfNode, FlashcardNode, FactcheckNode, HighlightNode, FetchResultNode, SummaryNode, NoteNode, ReferenceNode, SearchNode, CsvNode, ImageNode, SynthesisNode, ReviewNode) into fully self-contained plugins with protocol methods and comprehensive test suites, enhancing modularity and maintainability (multiple commits from 42af52 to e8e8aa) (Eric Ma)
- Added FileUploadRegistry and FileUploadHandlerPlugin base class to enable plugin-based backend file type handlers, laying the foundation for extensible file upload support (a29d52) (Eric Ma)
- Added private git repository support with credential management UI, backend API support, and secure storage scoped to the git-repo plugin (49683a) (Eric Ma)
- Added comprehensive documentation updates including plugin system changes, plugin building tutorials with prompt templates, and a detailed documentation map to assist developers and users (multiple commits from 55f84f to b661fc) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed keyboard shortcut 'e' to work correctly for git repo nodes by emitting the proper event and adding error handling and debug logging (cd9368, b173bd, 7b84bc) (Eric Ma)
- Corrected repository name extraction from git URLs to properly remove the ".git" suffix (22dd5d) (Eric Ma)
- Improved git repo file tree hover and expand/collapse behavior for better UI clarity and interaction (a87139) (Eric Ma)
- Fixed highlight node matching to constrain fuzzy matching region and prevent over-matching (30d1f0) (Eric Ma)
- Fixed reply behavior and node selection focus to prevent unwanted auto-focus and improve shortcut usability (f547dc) (Eric Ma)
- Fixed factcheck claim extraction and error handling to improve robustness and logging (6935ba) (Eric Ma)
- Fixed event listener registration and emission for nodeEditContent events on canvas instead of graph (7b84bc) (Eric Ma)
- Fixed array field extraction in CRDT graph to handle nested arrays correctly, resolving issues with poll options and other array fields (aa54ea) (Eric Ma)
- Updated all test imports to use plugins/ directory and enhanced test coverage and edge case handling across multiple plugins (f34330, 629a24) (Eric Ma)
- Fixed critical documentation inaccuracies and improved documentation coverage for APIs and plugin system (commit 08b11f, 0b4dd6) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- Removed git credentials methods and UI from core storage and index.html, moving all git credential management fully into the git-repo plugin for better encapsulation (05a6dd, 0e5deb) (Eric Ma)
- Removed hardcoded modal HTML from index.html and moved all plugin modals to plugin-scoped registration system for better modularity (0002732) (Eric Ma)
- Removed backwards compatibility wrappers and consolidated all plugins into a single plugins/ directory, removing legacy import paths and hardcoded type checks (72e8b8, 5e3f19) (Eric Ma)
- Removed SummaryNode, NoteNode, and PollFeature from built-in features and converted them to external or consolidated plugins (a0c613, 9a3ba8, 1f534e) (Eric Ma)
