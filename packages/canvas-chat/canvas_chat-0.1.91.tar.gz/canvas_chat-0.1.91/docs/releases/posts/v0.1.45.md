# Version 0.1.45

This release improves version management by making `pyproject.toml` the single source of truth and adds a fallback for version reading in Modal deployments. It also introduces a new documentation site with automated deployment, clarifies the code contribution policy, and fixes issues in the auto-release workflow.

## New Features

- Added a new MkDocs-based documentation site with Material theme, including CI/CD for automatic deployment and a Diataxis-based navigation structure. The docs link was added to the main README. (df2d5b) (Eric Ma)
- Introduced a `canvas-chat` CLI command to display the current version, leveraging the new versioning system. (fb03de) (Eric Ma)
- Added a code contribution policy to CONTRIBUTING.md, encouraging detailed feature requests via GitHub issues and recommending agentic coding tools with Plan Mode for exploration before posting. (519c5f) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Added a fallback to read the version from `pyproject.toml` directly in Modal deployments, which lack package metadata, and included `pyproject.toml` in the Modal image to support this. (9f31b4) (Eric Ma)
- Fixed the auto-release workflow to stage pre-commit fixes before verification. (48b2a0) (Eric Ma)
- Fixed trailing whitespace in the v0.1.44 release notes. (4b3b05) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- Removed the `.bumpversion.cfg` configuration file and replaced `bump2version` with `uv version --bump` in the auto-release workflow, making `pyproject.toml` the single source of truth for version numbers. (fb03de) (Eric Ma)
- Removed the `PAGES_SETUP.md` file as part of documentation restructuring. (217163) (Eric Ma)
