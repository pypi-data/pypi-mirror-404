# Version v0.1.89

This release introduces progressive loading of PPTX slides via a streaming endpoint, improving the user experience by showing slide structure and conversion progress in real time. Additionally, the UI now uses three dots ("...") instead of the Unicode ellipsis character for text truncation and status messages, enhancing consistency and compatibility.

## New Features

- Added progressive PPTX slide loading through a server-sent events (SSE) stream, allowing users to see slide structure and conversion progress as slides are processed (209225) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Replaced all Unicode ellipsis characters ('…') with three dots ('...') in user-facing text, including truncation logic and status messages, to ensure consistency and better compatibility (85d89a) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- None
