# Version 0.1.1

This release brings major improvements to the Canvas Chat experience, including a robust CI/CD pipeline, automatic PyPI publishing, a refactored Python package structure, and significant enhancements to the force-directed layout and node overlap handling. It also introduces LLM-generated release notes, improved test coverage, and a more reliable and maintainable codebase.

## New Features

- Add LLM-generated release notes using llamabot, with automated storage and GitHub release integration. (116346, Eric Ma)
- Add tests workflow for Python (3.11, 3.12, 3.13) and JavaScript, and update all GitHub Actions to latest versions. (9155ef, Eric Ma)
- Add automatic PyPI publishing on merge to main, with trusted publishing and version management. (e3afef, Eric Ma)
- Refactor to a proper Python package structure for PyPI publishing, including CLI entry point and improved test imports. (f836a6, Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Fix force-directed layout edge spring to respect node sizes, preventing large nodes from overlapping when connected by edges. (7ff72f, Eric Ma)
- Fix force-directed layout overlap detection for rectangles, ensuring repulsion only when bounding boxes actually intersect. (7c2ca1, Eric Ma)
- Fix resolveOverlaps to properly separate large nodes, improving convergence speed and correctness for heavily overlapping nodes. (53686c, Eric Ma)
- Fix handleNodeResummarize to use correct streaming pattern, and document API verification steps for agents. (3367d9, Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- No deprecations in this release.
