# Version 0.1.5

This release introduces URL fetching support to the /note command, allowing users to include content from web pages as markdown. It also improves development workflow by adding a pre-commit hook to keep the pixi.lock file in sync with pyproject.toml changes, ensuring dependency consistency.

## New Features

- Added URL fetching capability to the /note command, including a new API endpoint that converts web pages to markdown using Jina Reader and html2text as a fallback. Also included documentation and tests for this feature (e0117d) (Eric Ma)
- Added a local pre-commit hook that automatically updates the pixi.lock file when pyproject.toml changes, preventing the lockfile from becoming stale (976c60) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Synchronized pixi.lock file after version bump in the automated release workflow to maintain consistency (58bb2c) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations
