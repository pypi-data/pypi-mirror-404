# Version 0.1.40

This release includes an important bug fix to improve the reliability of running multiple research tasks in parallel.

## New Features

- No new features were added in this release.

## Bug Fixes

- Prevent parallel research tasks from interfering with each other by capturing necessary variables in closure constants before handling SSE streams. This resolves an issue where starting a second research task would cause the first one to display 'empty research instructions'. (0ed50f) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- No deprecations in this release.
