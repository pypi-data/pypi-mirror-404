# Version 0.1.47

This release focuses on major codebase refactoring for improved maintainability, enhanced test coverage for event binding safety, and workflow improvements to ensure atomic versioning and dependency updates. Several bug fixes address event listener issues after recent modularization.

## New Features

- Extracted major components from `app.js` into dedicated modules: UndoManager, SlashCommandMenu, modal handlers, and file upload handlers. This reduces the size of `app.js` by 16.5% and improves code organization and maintainability. (c3415d, Eric Ma)
- Added integration tests to ensure event listeners are safely bound to methods, preventing undefined method references during refactoring. Introduced reusable test helpers and documented testing patterns. (c89aa7, Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Updated event listeners for node title, content, and code editing to correctly use methods from the new modal manager, fixing issues caused by recent refactoring. (ac1e7d, Eric Ma)
- Refactored the auto-release workflow to combine version bump, release notes, and lockfile updates into a single commit, ensuring `pyproject.toml` and `pixi.lock` remain in sync and preventing pre-commit failures. (77e3f0, Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- No deprecations in this release.
