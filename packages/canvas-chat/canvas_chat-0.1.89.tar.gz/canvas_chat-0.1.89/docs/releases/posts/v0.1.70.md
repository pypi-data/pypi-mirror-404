# Version v0.1.70

This release introduces progressive TypeScript migration for the codebase, starting with converting tests and utility modules to TypeScript. The test runner now supports running both JavaScript and TypeScript test files seamlessly. Additionally, the event-driven tag system was improved to auto-apply tags to selected nodes and ensure proper re-rendering on tag changes. Documentation was updated to guide contributors on TypeScript usage and type checking requirements.

## New Features

- Converted tests to TypeScript with full type annotations and updated test runner to support `.ts` files using `tsx`, enabling incremental migration and better type safety (f69ae3) (Eric Ma)
- Added TypeScript support for `model-utils.ts` with type-safe function signatures and updated test imports accordingly (e49a95) (Eric Ma)
- Enhanced tag system to auto-apply new tags to selected nodes, preserve selection during tag operations, and trigger proper re-rendering on tag changes using an event-driven pattern (06f2c4) (Eric Ma)
- Documented TypeScript type checking requirements for new `.ts` files in contributor guidelines (86d47a) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Reverted premature TypeScript conversion of `model-utils.js` to maintain test compatibility until test infrastructure supports `.ts` imports (0c3d5f) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- None
