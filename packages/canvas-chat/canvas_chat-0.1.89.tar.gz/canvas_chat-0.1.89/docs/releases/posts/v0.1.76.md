# Version v0.1.76

This release introduces improved image generation features, including better visibility of prompts and models used, along with enhanced testing for the image generation plugin. Additionally, the continuous integration workflow has been made more robust by adding a PyPI version check to prevent duplicate publishing errors and switching to the httpx library for HTTP requests.

## New Features

- Added a HUMAN node to the /image command that displays the user's prompt and the model used for image generation, improving traceability and consistency with other features (c349fc) (Eric Ma)
- Added comprehensive tests for the image generation plugin, covering plugin loading, command routing, lifecycle hooks, node creation, and edge connections (771151) (Eric Ma)
- Added a PyPI version check step in the auto-release workflow to prevent publishing duplicate versions and avoid workflow failures due to partial previous runs (c788fe) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed the PyPI version check script to use the httpx library instead of requests, resolving a ModuleNotFoundError in the auto-release workflow (bd674f) (Eric Ma)
- Fixed the CI command to include the --with httpx option in the uvx command for the PyPI version check (334c7a) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- None
