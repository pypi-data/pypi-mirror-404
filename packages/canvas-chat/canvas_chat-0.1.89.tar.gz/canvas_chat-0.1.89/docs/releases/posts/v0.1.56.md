# Version v0.1.56

This release improves the code node scrolling behavior and execution state visualization, enhances the auto-release workflow reliability, and refines the UI styling for running and self-healing code nodes. It also fixes issues with the release notes generation process and output panel positioning in viewport-fitted mode.

## New Features

- Extracted a utility function to find the actual scrollable container in code nodes, improving scrolling accuracy and robustness with comprehensive tests (1d2807) (Eric Ma)
- Changed running code indicator to a pulsing border animation for a more subtle and distinctive visual effect (c135f6) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed auto-release workflow failure by adding the required 'v' prefix to the version flag for llamabot, ensuring release notes are generated correctly (f56fd2) (Eric Ma)
- Fixed code node scrolling by removing conflicting flex constraints and letting the parent container handle scrolling properly (206990) (Eric Ma)
- Fixed code node output panel positioning and scrolling in viewport-fitted mode for better UI behavior (773047) (github-actions)
- Fixed code execution state visualization by changing the indicator from a blue banner to a header color, ensuring visibility regardless of scroll position (78cbe2) (Eric Ma)
- Fixed CSS and JS to improve code-display scrolling and execution state styling, including pulse animations and color adjustments (f6051b) (Eric Ma)
- Fixed release notes generation to explicitly pass the version flag to llamabot, preventing incorrect version inference (905ff2) (Eric Ma)
- Addressed Copilot review comments by removing redundant CSS rules and improving scroll container detection with Set deduplication (dc33e1) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- Removed unused pulse-border animation in favor of pulse animation for header backgrounds (f6051b) (Eric Ma)
