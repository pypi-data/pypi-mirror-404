# Version v0.1.81

This release focuses on improving caching and performance in CI workflows, fixing permission and duplication issues with Ollama model caching, enhancing test coverage for the Generate UI workflow, and resolving several bugs related to the CodeFeature plugin and Cypress tests.

## New Features

- Added tests for the interactive Generate UI on code nodes, including showing, canceling via button or Escape key, and generating code with mocked responses (50705f) (Eric Ma)
- Enabled npm dependency caching in Cypress workflows to speed up CI by avoiding repeated npm installs (404267) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed permission errors by caching only the Ollama models directory instead of the entire .ollama directory, preventing access issues with sensitive files (39837b) (Eric Ma)
- Prevented duplicate Ollama model pulls in CI by checking if a model already exists before pulling, reducing redundant downloads (2413c3) (Eric Ma)
- Improved Ollama cache setup with explicit directory creation and enhanced logging for cache hits/misses and directory sizes (161910) (Eric Ma)
- Updated test_app_init to reflect CodeFeature migration by removing methods moved to the CodeFeature plugin, fixing CI test failures (07f71d) (Eric Ma)
- Fixed multiple CodeFeature issues including syntax errors, command registration, API usage, null checks, micropip loading, and Cypress test selectors to ensure stability and correctness (32332d) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- Removed duplicated /code command from BUILTIN_SLASH_COMMANDS as it is now managed by the CodeFeature plugin (32332d) (Eric Ma)
