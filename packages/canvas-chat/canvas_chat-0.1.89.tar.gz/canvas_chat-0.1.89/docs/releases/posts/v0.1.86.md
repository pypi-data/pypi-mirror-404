# Version v0.1.86

This release improves URL fetching by sanitizing HTML to markdown and enhancing security with CSS-safe node classes. It also refactors DuckDuckGo (DDG) search and research endpoints into a plugin with better source capping per iteration. Additionally, new end-to-end Cypress tests have been added for DDG search and research functionality.

## New Features

- Refactor DuckDuckGo search and research endpoints into a plugin and add a per-iteration source cap to allow all 4 iterations to run (cdfb19) (Eric Ma)
- Add Cypress end-to-end tests for DuckDuckGo search and research, including happy and error paths with stubbed API responses and SSE streams (7ff71e) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Sanitize fetched URLs to markdown using html2text, strip unsafe style/script tags, add CSS-safe kebab-case node classes, and add related tests to prevent raw HTML/CSS exposure (741bf5) (Eric Ma)
- Remove trailing whitespace in v0.1.85 release notes (e1b58c) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations
