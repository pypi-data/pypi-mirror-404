# Version 0.1.14

This release improves the node resizing behavior by fixing several bugs related to height and width adjustments. It also introduces a reset button to restore nodes to their default size and adds keyboard shortcut hints for better usability. Additionally, text wrapping and scrollbars now respond correctly to width changes.
