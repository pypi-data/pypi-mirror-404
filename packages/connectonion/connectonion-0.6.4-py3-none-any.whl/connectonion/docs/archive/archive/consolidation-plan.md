# Principle Documents Consolidation Plan

## Current Structure

### Documentation Principles
- `docs/principles.md` - How to write documentation (KEEP)

### Protocol Principles (TO CONSOLIDATE)
- `docs/roadmap/principles.md` - Core design principles
- `docs/roadmap/core-principles-extracted.md` - 15 extracted principles
- `docs/roadmap/simplicity-principles.md` - 15 simplicity principles  
- `docs/roadmap/master-principles.md` - Attempt at consolidation

### Semantic & Economic Insights (KEEP AS SEPARATE TOPICS)
- `docs/roadmap/semantic-revolution.md` - Semantic understanding
- `docs/roadmap/the-semantic-insight.md` - Core semantic insight
- `docs/roadmap/economic-analysis.md` - Cost economics
- `docs/roadmap/mini-whitepaper.md` - Cost-centric analysis

### Technical Documents (KEEP)
- `docs/roadmap/technical-architecture.md` - Implementation details
- `docs/roadmap/migration-strategy.md` - Migration guide
- `docs/roadmap/business-model.md` - Business strategy
- `docs/roadmap/attack-defense-insights.md` - Security analysis
- `docs/roadmap/mcp-comparison-insights.md` - MCP comparison
- (removed) `docs/roadmap/function-as-agent.md` - superseded by Share & Find

### Journey Documents (KEEP)
- `docs/roadmap/discussion-journey.md` - Our discussion history

## Proposed New Structure

### 1. Core Principles Document (`docs/roadmap/core-principles.md`)
Consolidate the best of all principle documents into categories:
- Fundamental Laws (3-5 most important)
- Design Principles (8-10 key principles)
- Implementation Principles (5-8 practical guidelines)
- Meta-Principles (3-5 principles about principles)

### 2. Topic-Specific Documents
Keep these as deep dives into specific aspects:
- Semantic insights
- Economic analysis  
- Security considerations
- Technical architecture

### 3. Reference Documents
- Mini white paper
- Migration strategy
- Business model

## Consolidation Strategy

1. **Identify Duplicates**: Many principles appear in multiple files with slight variations
2. **Choose Best Expression**: Pick the clearest, most insightful version
3. **Eliminate Redundancy**: Each principle appears once in the most appropriate section
4. **Maintain Coherence**: Ensure principles flow logically
5. **Preserve Insights**: Don't lose valuable nuances in consolidation

## Key Principles to Definitely Keep

From various documents:
1. Cost Conservation Law (成本守恒)
2. Behavior Over Identity (行为优于身份)  
3. Function as Primitive (函数即基元)
4. Simplicity Enables Robustness (简单促进健壮)
5. Semantic Understanding Changes Everything (语义改变一切)
6. Work as Authentication (工作即认证)
7. Local Experience Trumps Global (局部胜全局)
8. Immunity Over Prevention (免疫优于预防)
9. Time Heals and Reveals (时间治愈并揭示)
10. Natural Selection Works (自然选择有效)
