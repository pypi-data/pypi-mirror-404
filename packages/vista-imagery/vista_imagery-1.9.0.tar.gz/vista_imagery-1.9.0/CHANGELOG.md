## [1.9.0] - 2026-2-1

### Improvements

- 🥳 Addded undo with `ctrl` + `z` shortcut to tracks and detections panels.
- ✨ Made `Tracker` column editable in the Tracks Panel.
- ✨ Added a button on the tracks panel to re-order track rows by multiple ordered columns.
- 👷 Eliminated the `Tracker` object in favor of a flat list of `Track` objects with a `tracker` attribute.
- 🛠️ Updated all tracker to produce green tracks with circle by default.
- 🛠️ Updated track merging behavior so that new merged track tracker name is combines the unique tracker names in all the merged tracks.
- 🛠️ Updated tracks and detections tables so that some columns are resizable.
- 🛠️ Removed unnecessary `_resize_track_column` function.

### Bug Fixes

- 🔧 Fixed bug tracks with labels that are parsed as numeric would not load such as `1`.
- 🔧 Fixed bug where adding detections to track could get stuck as on and disabled when user selects detections, presses add to track, makes a new detection selection, and then cancels that selection.
- 🔧 Fixed bug where changing sensor did not clear track uncertainty ellipses from the previously selected sensor.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-1-29

### Bug Fixes

- 🔧 Fixed bug where removing all points from a detector removes detector from table, but not from viewer.
- 🔧 When a user clicks the color cell or uses bulk color actions, the code searches for tracks by name. This fails or finds the wrong track when:
  - Multiple tracks have the same name (which is allowed)
  - Tracks have been renamed after the table was populated
  - Tracks with the same color might have been created with the same default name
- 🔧 Updated all objects that require looks at equality checks to use `uuid`. This prevents bizarre, difficult to reproduce errors that could occur after long-term usage.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-1-28

### Improvements
- Updated tracks panel bulk actions so that they take effect immediately without having to press the apply button.
- Added the ability to specify whether to show all detections through "complete" column.
- Added more details on detections CSV format to documentation.
- Added the ability to perform bulk actions on detections.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue where lasso could only be used when imagery is loaded.
- Fixed issue where lasso could only select one track even though multiple could be highlighted.
- Fixed issue where when tracks were deleted that have uncertainty ellipses plotted, the ellipses would remain in the imagery viewer.
- Fixed issue where applying bulks actions removed tracks froms selection in the tracks table.
- Fixed `user_guide_tracks_covariance.gif` so that it loops indefinitely.

- Added the ability to define covariance matrices for track points.
- Consolidated the static and animated track details plot into a single component

- Update detection/track tables so that hidden columns are persisted.
- Added ability to view static or animated plots (synchronized to player) of track data.
- Combined `unix_time` and `unix_fine_time` into `unix_nanoseconds` which provides nanosecond precision until April 11, 2262.
- Added the ability to set track line style as a bulk action.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed bug where the indices of selected tracks were remembered such that after deleting selected tracks and loading 
  or creating new tracks, the new track would show as highlighted even though they were not yet selected.
- Fixed bug where package distributions were missing some files from MANIFEST
- Fixed several issues that could result in excessive memory usage growth during long sessions.
- Fixed issue where users could only add detection / track labels rather than completely resetting them.
- Fixed bug that could occur when imagery is created with no frames.
- Fixed mistake in error message when trying to create track or detections manually when no sensor is selected.

## [1.6.5] - 2025-12-13

### New Features
- Added `VISTA_LABELS` environment variable to pre-configure labels from CSV files, JSON files, or comma-separated values
