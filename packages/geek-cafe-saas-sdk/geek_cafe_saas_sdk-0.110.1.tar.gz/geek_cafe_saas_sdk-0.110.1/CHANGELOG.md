## [0.100.1] - 2026-01-25

### 🐛 Fixed - Critical Pagination Bug

**ExecutionFileService Pagination**
- Fixed `get_files_by_execution()` to fetch **ALL pages** of results, not just first page
- Previously only returned ~100-400 items (DynamoDB's 1MB page limit)
- Now automatically loops through all pages using `LastEvaluatedKey`
- Added detailed logging for pagination tracking (pages fetched, total items)
- Added `ascending` parameter (default: `True`) to control sort order
- Optimized `limit` parameter to pass to DynamoDB, reducing read requests

**ServiceResult Improvements**
- Added `metadata` field for non-error response metadata (pagination, stats, warnings)
- Moved `LastEvaluatedKey` from `error_details` to `metadata` (semantically correct)
- `error_details` now only used for actual errors (`success=False`)

**Impact:**
- ✅ Fixes data loss when retrieving 1000+ calculation results
- ✅ Prevents silent truncation of large result sets
- ✅ Ensures complete data retrieval for workflows with many files

**Example:**
```python
# Now retrieves ALL 1000 calculation results across multiple pages
result = execution_file_service.get_files_by_execution(
    execution_id="exec-123",
    file_type="calculation",
    file_role="result"
)
# Previously: 846 results (first 6 pages)
# Now: 1000 results (all pages)
```

**Root Cause:**
- DynamoDB queries return max 1MB per page (~100-400 items depending on size)
- Previous implementation didn't handle `LastEvaluatedKey` pagination
- For 1000+ items, only first page was returned, causing systematic data loss

**Migration:**
- No code changes required - pagination is automatic
- Existing calls will now return complete results
- May see increased latency for very large result sets (expected behavior)

## [0.100.0] - 2026-01-25

### 🚀 Added - ServiceFactory for Connection Pooling

**ServiceFactory**
- New `ServiceFactory` class for centralized service creation with connection pooling
- Lazy-loaded shared connections (DynamoDB, S3, SQS) using boto3-assist v0.36.0
- `create_service()` method for dependency injection
- `reset_connections()` for testing
- `get_stats()` for debugging connection usage

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Reuses boto3 sessions in Lambda warm containers
- ✅ Reduces connection overhead and improves performance
- ✅ Centralized connection management
- ✅ Request context never cached (security)

**Usage:**
```python
# Module-level factory (reused in warm container)
_service_factory = ServiceFactory()

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Fresh context per request
    request_context = SystemRequestContext(
        tenant_id=event["tenant_id"],
        user_id=event["user_id"]
    )
    
    # Create service with shared connection + fresh context
    user_service = _service_factory.create_service(
        UserService,
        request_context=request_context
    )
    
    return user_service.get_by_id(event["user_id"])
```

### 💥 BREAKING CHANGES

**DatabaseService Constructor**
- `dynamodb` parameter is now **REQUIRED** (no default)
- `table_name` parameter is now **REQUIRED** (no default)
- Services must be created via `ServiceFactory` or explicit injection

**Before (v0.87.0):**
```python
# Old pattern - NO LONGER WORKS
service = UserService(request_context=context)
```

**After (v0.100.0):**
```python
# New pattern - REQUIRED
factory = ServiceFactory()
service = factory.create_service(UserService, request_context=context)

# Or explicit injection
service = UserService(
    dynamodb=db,
    table_name="my-table",
    request_context=context
)
```

**Migration Required:**
- All service instantiation must use `ServiceFactory` or explicit injection
- No more automatic `DynamoDB()` creation
- No more automatic table name from environment

**Why This Change:**
- Enforces best practices for Lambda performance
- Prevents accidental connection proliferation
- Makes dependencies explicit and testable
- Aligns with SOLID principles

### 📦 Dependencies

- Requires `boto3-assist>=0.36.0` for connection pooling support

## [0.87.0] - 2026-01-25

### 🐛 Fixed - WorkflowStep Timestamp Tracking

**WorkflowStep Model**
- Added helper methods for consistent timestamp setting
- `set_dispatched_time()` - Sets both `dispatched_utc` and `dispatched_utc_ts`
- `set_started_time()` - Sets both `started_utc` and `started_utc_ts`
- `set_completed_time()` - Sets both `completed_utc`, `completed_utc_ts`, and calculates `duration_ms`

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Consistent timestamp format (ISO string + float)
- ✅ Automatic duration calculation
- ✅ No more missing timestamp fields

## [0.72.2] - 2026-01-12

### 🐛 Fixed - Queue State Release Tracking

**WorkflowService.start()**
- Fixed `queue_state` to update from `"throttled"` to `"released"` when execution starts running
- Prevents confusing historical records where succeeded executions still show as `"throttled"`
- Provides clear audit trail: `"primary"` (never throttled), `"throttled"` (currently waiting), `"released"` (was throttled, now running/completed)

**Example:**
- Before: Succeeded execution shows `queueState: "throttled"` ❌ (confusing)
- After: Succeeded execution shows `queueState: "released"` ✅ (clear it escaped throttle)

## [0.72.1] - 2026-01-11

### 🐛 Fixed - Progress Percent Sync in Status Summary

**WorkflowService.get_status()**
- Fixed summary `progressPercent` to use execution's actual progress when higher than calculated from steps
- Prevents mismatch where execution shows 10% but summary shows 0% (before any steps complete)
- Summary now respects orchestration-level progress updates

**Example:**
- Before: execution.progressPercent=10, summary.progressPercent=0 ❌
- After: execution.progressPercent=10, summary.progressPercent=10 ✅

## [0.72.0] - 2026-01-11

### 🚀 Added - Retry & Queue State Tracking

**Workflow Model Enhancements**
- Added `first_throttled_utc` / `first_throttled_utc_ts` - Track when execution was first throttled
- Added `last_retry_utc` / `last_retry_utc_ts` - Track timestamp of last retry attempt
- Added properties for all new timestamp fields

**Benefits**
- ✅ Retry state now persisted to DynamoDB, not just SQS messages
- ✅ Can query executions stuck in throttle from database
- ✅ Track time spent in throttle for analytics
- ✅ Better observability and debugging capabilities

**Backward Compatibility**
- All new fields are optional (default `None`)
- Existing executions continue to work without these fields
- SQS message-based retry tracking still works as fallback

## [0.71.0] - 2026-01-11

### 🐛 Fixed - Metrics Cleanup on Execution Completion

**WorkflowService Updates**
- Added automatic metrics cleanup when executions complete, fail, or are cancelled
- Prevents stale metrics from accumulating and causing false throttling
- Added `_cleanup_execution_metrics()` helper method

## [0.6.0] - 2025-10-15
