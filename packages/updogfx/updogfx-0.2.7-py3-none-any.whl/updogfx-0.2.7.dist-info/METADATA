# UPDOGFX2 by EFXTv

**UPDOGFX2** is a lightweight, feature-rich HTTP file server written in Python. It allows you to serve files locally or expose them to the internet instantly using an automated Cloudflare Tunnel—no port forwarding required.

## ✨ Features

* **Instant Public URL:** Integrated Cloudflare Tunneling for remote access.
* **Web-Based Editor:** Edit text files (`.py`, `.html`, `.js`, etc.) directly in your browser.
* **File Management:** Upload and delete files via a clean, responsive UI.
* **Progress Tracking:** Real-time progress bar for file uploads.
* **Security Controls:** Easily disable editing, uploading, or deleting via command-line flags.

## 🚀 Installation

You can install `updogfx` directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install updogfx

```

---

## 🛠 Usage

Once installed, you can start the server by simply typing:

```bash
updogfx

```

### Custom Options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-p [port]` | Set a custom local port (Default: 3001) |
| `disable` | Runs in **View Only** mode (Disables upload, edit, and delete) |
| `disable edit` | Disables the built-in text editor |
| `disable upload` | Prevents users from uploading files |
| `disable cloudflared` | Runs only on `localhost` (No public URL) |

### Examples

**Start on port 8080 with a public URL:**

```bash
updogfx -p 8080

```

**View-only mode (Safe for public sharing):**

```bash
updogfx disable

```

**Public upload server (No editing allowed):**

```bash
updogfx disable edit

```

## 📂 Requirements

* **Python:** 3.x
* **Cloudflare:** To use the tunneling feature, ensure `cloudflared` is installed on your system. If not found, the script will automatically fallback to local mode.
