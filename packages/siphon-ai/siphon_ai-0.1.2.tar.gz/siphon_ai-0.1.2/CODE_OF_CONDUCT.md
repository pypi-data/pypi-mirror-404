# SIPHON Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

SIPHON is a LiveKit-based telephony AI agent framework. It is intended to make it easier to build responsible, production-grade AI calling systems.

This Code of Conduct defines expectations for everyone who participates in the SIPHON ecosystem, including:

- Users of the framework
- Contributors and maintainers
- Community members in issues, discussions, and any official channels

Our goal is to foster a respectful, safe, and inclusive environment for collaboration.

---

## 2. Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all SIPHON-related spaces, including but not limited to:

- Project repositories and issue trackers
- Pull requests, code reviews, and discussions
- Any official communication channels hosted or moderated by SIPHON maintainers

It also applies when representing the project in public spaces, such as conferences, social media, or blog posts, where you are identifiable as a SIPHON user, contributor, or maintainer.

## 3. Our Standards

### 3.1 Expected behavior

- **Be respectful**  
  Treat everyone with courtesy and professionalism. Disagreement is normal; disrespect is not.

- **Be inclusive**  
  Welcome people of all backgrounds, experience levels, and identities. Avoid exclusionary or dismissive behavior.

- **Be constructive**  
  - Provide helpful feedback on issues, proposals, and pull requests.  
  - Focus on the code, design, and use cases, not the person.

- **Protect users and data**  
  - Treat telephony and conversational data as sensitive by default.  
  - Respect privacy laws and best practices when using SIPHON in production.  
  - Avoid sharing real user data or secrets (API keys, credentials, phone numbers) in public spaces.

- **Promote responsible AI use**  
  - Avoid building or promoting abusive, deceptive, or clearly harmful calling experiences with SIPHON (e.g., fraud, harassment, spam).  
  - Follow applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction, especially those related to telecom, privacy, consent, and AI.

### 3.2 Unacceptable behavior

- **Harassment or discrimination**, including:
  - Hate speech, personal attacks, or slurs.
  - Sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusionary comments or jokes.

- **Abusive community behavior**, such as:
  - Persistent trolling or flame wars.
  - Threats of violence or doxxing.
  - Deliberately derailing conversations or PRs.

- **Irresponsible or malicious use of SIPHON**, including:
  - Using SIPHON to create harassing, deceptive, or non-consensual calling systems.
  - Intentionally bypassing consent, opt-out, or applicable telephony/AI regulations.
  - Publicly sharing sensitive call logs, transcripts, or recordings without proper redaction and consent.

- **Unprofessional collaboration**, such as:
  - Repeatedly ignoring review feedback or project guidelines.
  - Misrepresenting others’ work as your own.
  - Spamming issues, PRs, or discussions.

## 5. Reporting & Enforcement

- **How to report**  
  - You can report violations or concerns by contacting the maintainers at:

  - Reports will be reviewed by the maintainers in good faith.  
  - When appropriate, they may:
    - Ask clarifying questions.  
    - Take action on GitHub or other platforms (warnings, content removal, access restrictions).  
    - Escalate or involve platform support if needed.

- **Confidentiality**  
  - The maintainers will treat reports as confidential to the extent reasonably possible, and will only share details as required to investigate and act.

    - Verbal or written warning  
    - Temporary or permanent ban from project spaces  
    - Reversion or rejection of contributions
