      <p>
        This is a placeholder page for account deletion. Implement your deletion flow
        here (e.g., a confirmation form that deletes the current user and transfers or
        removes their organization as appropriate).
      </p>
      <p>
        For now, this page exists so templates can link to an account deletion route
        without causing errors during rendering.
