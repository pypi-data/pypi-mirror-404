Focus on your content and let WriteADoc take care of the rest


## Main features

* **Simple yet powerful formatting**: Write in Markdown, plus enjoy powerful features like callbacks, flexible code blocks, and _much more_.
* **Built-in full-text search**: Automatically generates a full-text search index for you. No third-party service required.
* **Multi-language & multi-version capable**: Easily manage documentation for multiple versions and languages, right out of the box. No plugins or complicated setup needed.
* **Works on all devices and with light/dark modes**: WriteADoc automatically adapts to perfectly fit the available screen, no matter the type or size of the viewing device and whether you're an early bird or a night owl.
* **Always yours**: A static site means you can host it anywhere. You own your content and your site. No need to trust your product knowledge to third-party platforms.
