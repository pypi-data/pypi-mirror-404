Type alias for pre-execution hook functions.

Pre-hooks are called before task execution, allowing modification of task.inputs.
They receive only the TaskModelType instance and can modify it in-place.

Example:
    async def my_pre_hook(task: TaskModelType) -> None:
        if task.inputs is None:
            task.inputs = {}

"""
Type alias for post-execution hook functions.

Post-hooks are called after task execution completes, receiving the task,
final input data, and execution result. Useful for logging, notifications, etc.

Args:
    task: The TaskModelType instance
    inputs: The final input parameters used for execution
    result: The execution result (or error information)

Example:

# Task Priority Notes:
# - Priority is an integer value used for task scheduling
# - TaskManager uses ASC (ascending) order following industry standard:
#   Lower numbers = Higher priority (executes earlier)
# - Recommended values (following industry standard):
#   0 = urgent (highest priority, executes first)
#   1 = high
#   2 = normal
#   3 = low (lowest priority, executes last)
# - This follows Linux kernel (nice values), POSIX, and real-time system conventions
# - If priority is None or missing, default to 999 (lowest priority, executes last)
