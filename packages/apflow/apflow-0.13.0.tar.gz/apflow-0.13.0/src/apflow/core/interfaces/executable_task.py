    Executable task interface - all executable units must implement this interface

    - CrewaiExecutor [crewai]: LLM-based agent crews (via CrewAI) - available in extensions/crewai/
    - SystemInfoExecutor [stdio]: Safe system information queries - available in extensions/stdio/
    - CommandExecutor [stdio]: Shell command execution - available in extensions/stdio/

    Note: BatchCrewaiExecutor is NOT an ExecutableTask. BatchCrewaiExecutor is a container that batches multiple crews
