"""
Test to verify that generated CrewAI tasks don't use template variables for dependency data.

This test verifies the fix for the issue where CrewAI tasks would fail with:
"Missing required template variable 'content' not found in inputs dictionary"

The problem was that the LLM was instructed to use template variables like {content}
for dependency data, but the framework stores dependency results with task IDs as keys.
