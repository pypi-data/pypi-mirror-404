# Sequenzo: Fast, scalable, and intuitive social sequence analysis in Python

Sequenzo is a high-performance Python package designed for social sequence analysis. 

Its methodological foundations build upon prior work in the R ecosystem, especially
[the TraMineR (Gabadinho et al. 2011) R package](https://traminer.unige.ch/), which
established many of the core concepts, representations, and analytical tools in
sequence analysis, as well as subsequent methodological extensions developed within
[TraMineRextras (Gabadinho et al. 2021)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TraMineRextras/index.html).

Sequenzo also draws inspiration from
[WeightedCluster (Studer, 2013)](https://mephisto.unige.ch/weightedcluster/) for
typology construction,
[seqHMM (Helske & Helske, 2019)](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v088i03) for
probabilistic modeling using hidden Markov models,
and [ggseqplot (Raab, 2022)](https://maraab23.github.io/ggseqplot/) for the design of
relative frequency sequence visualizations (Fasang & Liao, 2013).

We gratefully acknowledge these pioneering contributions and the broader community in social sequence analysis whose work enables everything we do. Sequenzo seeks to expand the social sequence analysis ecosystem by connecting long-standing methodological traditions with the computational practices of the Python data science community, particularly in machine learning and deep learning.

---

Sequenzo is built to analyze **any sequence of categorical events**, from individual career paths and migration patterns to corporate growth and urban development. 
Whether you are working with **people, places, or policies**, Sequenzo helps uncover meaningful patterns efficiently. 

Sequenzo outperforms traditional R-based tools in social sequence analysis, delivering faster processing and superior efficiency, especially for large-scale datasets. **No big data? No problem. You don’t need big data to benefit as Sequenzo is designed to enhance sequence analysis at any scale, making complex methods accessible to everyone.**

> 🚀 **Explore the official documentation at [sequenzo.yuqi-liang.tech](https://sequenzo.yuqi-liang.tech/en/)**  
> with tutorials, practical examples, and API references to help you get started quickly.  
>  
> 📖 Available in **English and Chinese**, our docs are written to be approachable, practical, and easy to follow.

## Target Users

Sequenzo is designed for:

- Quantitative researchers in sociology, demography, political science, economics, management, etc.
- Data scientists, data analysts, and business analysts working on trajectory/time-series clustering
- Educators teaching courses involving social sequence data
- Users familiar with R packages such as `TraMineR` who want a Python-native alternative

## Why Choose Sequenzo?

🚀 **High Performance**

Leverages Python’s computational power to achieve 8× faster processing than traditional R-based tools like TraMineR.

🎯 **Easy-to-Use API**

Designed with simplicity in mind: intuitive functions streamline complex sequence analysis without compromising flexibility.

🌍 **Flexible for Any Scenario**

Perfect for research, policy, and business, enabling seamless analysis of categorical data and its evolution over time.

## Platform Compatibility

Sequenzo provides pre-built Python wheels for maximum compatibility — no need to compile from source.

| Platform         | Architecture                   | Python Versions       | Status            |
|------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| **macOS**        | Intel && Apple Silicon (64-bit) | 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 | ✅ Pre-built wheel |
| **Windows**      | `AMD64`(64-bit)     | 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 | ✅ Pre-built wheel |
| **Linux (glibc)**| `x86_64` (standard Linux)      | 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 | ✅ Pre-built wheel |
| **Linux (musl)** | `x86_64` (Alpine Linux)        | 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 | ✅ Pre-built wheel |


What do these terms mean?
- **macosx_arm64 (macOS)**: One wheel supports Apple Silicon Macs.
- **macosx_x86_64 (macOS)**: One wheel supports Intel Macs.
- **manylinux2014_x86_64 (glibc-based Linux)**: Compatible with most mainstream Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS).
- **musllinux_1_2 (musl-based Linux)**: For lightweight Alpine Linux environments, common in Docker containers.
- **AMD64 (Windows)**: Standard 64-bit Windows system architecture.

All of these wheels are pre-built and available on PyPI — so `pip install sequenzo` should work on supported platforms, without needing a compiler.

**Windows (win32)** and **Linux (i686)** are dropped due to:

- Extremely low usage in modern systems (post-2020)
- Memory limitations (≤ 4GB) unsuitable for scientific computing workloads
- Increasing incompatibility with packages such as `numpy`, `scipy`, and `pybind11`
- Frequent build failures and maintenance overhead in CI/CD pipelines


## Installation

If you haven't installed Python, please follow [Yuqi's tutorial about how to set up Python and your virtual environment](https://www.yuqi-liang.tech/blog/setup-python-virtual-environment/). 

Once Python is installed, we highly recommend using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) as your IDE (Integrated Development Environment — the place where you open your folder and files to work with Python), rather than Visual Studio. PyCharm has excellent built-in support for managing virtual environments, making your workflow much easier and more reliable.

In PyCharm, please make sure to select a virtual environment using Python 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11 as these versions are fully supported by `sequenzo`.

Then, you can open the built-in terminal by clicking the Terminal icon 
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e9e3af0-4286-47ba-aa88-29c3288cb7cb" alt="terminal icon" width="30" style="display:inline; vertical-align:middle;"> 
in the left sidebar (usually near the bottom). It looks like a small command-line window icon.

Once it’s open, type the following to install `sequenzo`:

```
pip install sequenzo
```

If you have some issues with the installation, it might because you have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed on your computer. In this case, you can try to use `pip3` instead of `pip` to install the package.

```
pip3 install sequenzo
```
