## Dataset

- Notebooks for visualization and presentation are located
  under [`references`](references).

## Conda / Mamba Environment Setup

```

To update the environment after updating environment.yml

**_BEST PRACTICE, RECOMMENDED_** when updating a conda environment

```shell

Everyone works with the project should have a sub-folder named by their id
under it, and any scripts, doc, or data that are temporary should be placed
there.
