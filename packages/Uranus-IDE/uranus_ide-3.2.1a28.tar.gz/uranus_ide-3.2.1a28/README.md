# Uranus IDE

Uranus is a lightweight, extensible Python IDE inspired by Jupyter. It supports interactive coding, markdown documentation, and modular plugin architecture — all built with PyQt5.

> 🔥 **Uranus IDE is the first modular Python IDE with full RTL support across all editing modes.**

## Features

- 🧠 Code and Markdown cells with live execution
- 📊 Output viewers for text, tables, and images
- 🧰 Customizable toolbar and editor settings
- 🧾 Project scaffolding with license and metadata
- 🧱 File explorer with context menu and keyboard shortcuts


### ✨ Key Features

- ✅ Cell-based editing with IPython kernel
- ✅ Modular architecture with PyQt5
- ✅ **Full RTL (Right-to-Left) support** for Persian, Arabic, and other RTL languages
- ✅ Custom file explorer with inline editing
- ✅ Project creation and metadata management


## 🧩 Advanced Window & Memory Features

Uranus IDE goes beyond traditional editors by introducing two powerful features that elevate both usability and introspection:

## 🐍 Python Error & Lint Testing

Uranus IDE integrates a **built‑in error and lint analyzer** powered by [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff).  
This feature allows developers to run static analysis directly inside the IDE and instantly detect:

- ❌ **Syntax and style errors** (indentation, spacing, line length, etc.)  
- ⚠️ **Warnings** for risky or non‑optimal code patterns  
- 🧩 **Unused imports, undefined names, and logical issues**  
- 📏 **Customizable rule categories** with checkboxes for enabling/disabling specific families (e.g. `E`, `W`, `F`, `B`, `UP`)  
- 🎨 **Color‑coded output highlighting** for errors, warnings, and success messages  

The analyzer window provides a **dark‑themed interface** with live feedback and a status bar that displays rule descriptions when hovering over checkboxes. Developers can tailor the analysis to their workflow by ignoring selected categories and re‑running checks with a single click.

> With this addition, Uranus IDE becomes not only an interactive coding environment but also a **powerful linting and error‑testing tool** for Python projects.

### 🔀 Detachable WorkWindows — Seamless Floating Mode

Switch any notebook window between embedded (MDI) and floating mode with a single click — without losing content, focus, or execution state. This feature enables:

- Multi-monitor workflows with independent execution panels
- Persistent cell layout and toolbar state across transitions
- Instant toggling via the "Detach" checkbox in the top toolbar

> Built with robust parent migration logic, Uranus ensures that every cell, output, and toolbar remains intact during window transitions.

### 🧠 Attribute Table — Inspect Your Runtime Like a Pro

Uranus includes a dynamic attribute inspector that visualizes all user-defined variables and objects in a structured table:

| Name         | Type     | Size (bytes) | Value Preview |
|--------------|----------|--------------|----------------|
| `df`         | DataFrame| 2048         | `<table>`      |
| `img`        | Image    | 5120         | `<image>`      |
| `model`      | Class    | 1024         | `<object>`     |

Features:
- Recursively inspects attributes of user-defined classes and instances
- Filters internal and unsupported types for clarity
- Displays live memory footprint and object type
- Fully integrated with IPython kernel and object store

> Whether you're debugging a complex pipeline or teaching data structures, this table gives you full visibility into your runtime environment.

These features are designed and implemented by [Atila Ghashghaie](https://github.com/atila-gh) — bringing modular architecture and deep introspection to the heart of Python development.

### Python Script Editor 
This module provides a dedicated Python editor and console inside Uranus IDE.  
It can display and edit `.py` files, run them in Python kernel.

### 📝 Comment Headings

Uranus IDE now supports special formatting for comments:

- `##` makes the comment font **2 points larger** than normal.  
- `###` makes the comment font **4 points larger** and **bold**.  

This allows you to create **visual headings inside your code** for better readability and teaching.

### 📝 Independent Markdown Editor

Uranus IDE now includes a **dedicated Markdown editor** that operates independently from the code environment.  
This editor provides a professional space for writing and managing documentation, tutorials, and project notes.  
Key benefits include:

- Full support for standard Markdown syntax (headings, lists, tables, images, links)
- A distraction-free environment tailored for documentation
- Ideal for creating technical reports, teaching materials, or project guides

With this addition, Uranus IDE becomes not only a coding platform but also a complete solution for **professional documentation workflows**.

### ⏱ Code Cell Execution Timer

Each code cell in Uranus IDE is now equipped with an **execution time display**.  
This feature automatically measures:

- The total runtime of the current cell execution
- The **delta** (difference) compared to the previous execution of the same cell

This allows developers and educators to:

- Benchmark performance changes between runs
- Identify bottlenecks in code execution
- Gain immediate feedback on optimization efforts

By integrating execution timing directly into the cell interface, Uranus IDE makes performance analysis seamless and intuitive.
