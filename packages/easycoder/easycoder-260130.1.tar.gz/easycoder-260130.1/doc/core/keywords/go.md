# go

## Syntax:
`go [to] {label}`  
`goto {label}`

## Examples:
`go to Step5`  
`go Step5`  
`goto Step5`

## Description:
`go` and `goto` transfer control unconditionally to the named label. Execution continues from that point. The `to` keyword is optional when using the `go` form—it's syntactic sugar for readability.
