# ADR-0008: Discovery UX and Panel Identity

Status: Accepted

## Context

E27 panels may change IP addresses and users may not know MACs.
The mobile app provides a discovery-first experience.

## Decision

Discovery mirrors E27 mobile app behavior.

- UDP broadcast discovery is used during setup.
- UI guides selection by panel name.
- MAC address is the definitive identity.
- Serial number is captured post-connect as a secondary anchor.
- Reconnects rediscover and bind by MAC.

## Rationale

This provides a robust UX while ensuring correct panel binding.

## Consequences

- Discovery is required infrastructure.
- Silent panel switching is prohibited.

## Scope / Non-Goals

- Does not mandate discovery cadence.
- Does not require network discovery in all environments.
