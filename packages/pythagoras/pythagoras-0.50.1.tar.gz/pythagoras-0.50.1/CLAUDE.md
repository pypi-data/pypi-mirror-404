## Git Repository Usage

**CRITICAL: ALWAYS work directly in the main repository. NEVER use git worktrees.**

When working on this project:
- All changes must be made in the main repository at `/Users/vladimirpavlov/PycharmProjects/Pythagoras`
- Do not create or use git worktrees under any circumstances
- Do not suggest using worktrees as a workflow option
- If you detect you are in a worktree, immediately notify the user and request to switch to the main repository
