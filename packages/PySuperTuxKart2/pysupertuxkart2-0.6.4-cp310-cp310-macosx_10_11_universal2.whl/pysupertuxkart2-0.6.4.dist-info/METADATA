# Python SuperTuxKart 2

[![Documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pystk2/badge/?version=latest)](http://pystk2.rtfd.io/)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/PySuperTuxKart2.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/PySuperTuxKart2)

This is a modified version of the free SuperTuxKart racing game with Python bindings.
A lot of code was borrowed from [PySTK](https://github.com/philkr/pystk), with some main differences:

- The code is now quite close to SuperTuxKart (no code deletion) so that SuperTuxKart updates can be easily applied
- The assets are now downloaded in a "cache" directory (no more data package)
- (project) races can be run in parallel (e.g. for Reinforcement Learning experiments)

The current source code is based on the SuperTuxKart 1.4 branch. The PySTK changelog can be found [in this file](./CHANGELOG_PYSTK.md).

SuperTuxKart is a free kart racing game. It focuses on fun and not on realistic kart physics. Instructions can be found on the in-game help page.

The SuperTuxKart homepage can be found at <https://supertuxkart.net/>. There is also our [FAQ](https://supertuxkart.net/FAQ) and information on how get in touch with the [community](https://supertuxkart.net/Community).

## Hardware Requirements

<!-- 
To run SuperTuxKart, make sure that your computer's specifications are equal or higher than the following specifications:
-->
To visualize the races (not mandatory), make sure that you computer's specifications are equal or higher than the following specifications:

* A graphics card capable of 3D rendering - NVIDIA GeForce 470 GTX, AMD Radeon 6870 HD series card or Intel HD Graphics 4000 and newer. OpenGL >= 3.3
* You should have a dual-core CPU that's running at 1 GHz or faster.
* You'll need at least 512 MB of free VRAM (video memory).
* System memory: 1 GB
* Minimum disk space: 700 MB
* Ideally, you'll want a joystick with at least 6 buttons.

## License

The software is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) which can be found in the file [`COPYING`](/COPYING) in the same directory as this file.

## 3D coordinates

A reminder for those who are looking at the code and 3D models:

SuperTuxKart: X right, Y up, Z forwards

Blender: X right, Y forwards, Z up

The export utilities  perform the needed transformation, so in Blender you just work with the XY plane as ground, and things will appear fine in STK (using XZ as ground in the code, obviously). 


## Building from source

Building instructions can be found in [`INSTALL.md`](/INSTALL.md)

## Python bindings

- `pystk.[hc]pp`: manage races
- `state.[hc]pp`: observable and actions
- `pyckle.[hc]pp`: pickly states
- `fake_input_device.[hc]pp`: a fake input device used to control players
- `utils.[hc]pp`, `views.hpp`
- `buffer.[hc]pp`

`PYSTK_LOG_LEVEL` can control the log level (`debug`, `verbose`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`)
