You can choose to always show the **Taxes** column in the Purchase Order reports
when the taxes on the document belong to certain tax groups (e.g. domestic transactions).
To do so:

- Go to *Invoicing/Accounting > Configuration > Tax Groups*.
- Enable **Show Tax Column in Purchase Report**: If enabled, the **Taxes**
  column will always be shown on the Purchase Order report for this tax group,
  even when all order lines share the same taxes.
