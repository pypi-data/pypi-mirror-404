Use Cases / Context
===================

When the taxes are the same in every purchase line, that information
might be redundant with the taxes summary and takes valuable space that
other columns might take.

This might be event more annoying when there's tax exemptions like in EU
intracomunitary operations.

Configuration
=============

You can choose to always show the **Taxes** column in the Purchase Order
reports when the taxes on the document belong to certain tax groups
(e.g. domestic transactions). To do so:

- Go to *Invoicing/Accounting > Configuration > Tax Groups*.
- Enable **Show Tax Column in Purchase Report**: If enabled, the
  **Taxes** column will always be shown on the Purchase Order report for
  this tax group, even when all order lines share the same taxes.

Usage
=====

Whenever the taxes are in the same group for the whole order the column
won't be displayed in the purchase order printed report.
