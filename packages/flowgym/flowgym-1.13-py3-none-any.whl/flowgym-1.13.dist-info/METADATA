`flowgym` is a library for reward adaptation of any pre-trained flow model on any data modality.

## Installation

In order to install *flowgym*, execute the following command:
```bash
pip install flowgym
```

*flowgym* requires PyTorch 2.3.1, and there may be other hard dependencies. Please open an issue if
installation fails through the above command.

Molecule environments depend on [FlowMol](https://github.com/cristianpjensen/FlowMol),
which currently needs to be installed manually:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/cristianpjensen/FlowMol.git@8f4c98cbe68111e4e63480b250d925b6d960d3bc
```

Some image rewards depend on the clip package, which needs to be installed manually as well:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git
```

## High-level overview

Diffusion and flow models are largely agnostic to their data modality. They only require that the underlying data type supports a small set of operations. Building on this idea, *flowgym* is designed to be fully modular. You only need to provide the following:
 * Data type `YourDataType` that implements `FlowProtocol`, which defines some functions necessary for interacting with it as a flow model.
 * Base model `BaseModel[YourDataType]`, which defines the scheduler, how to sample $p_0$, how to compute the forward pass, and how to preprocess and postprocess data.
 * Reward function `Reward[YourDataType]`.

Once these are defined, you can sample from the flow model and apply reward adaptation methods, such as Value Matching.

## Documentation

Much more information can be found in [the documentation](https://cristianpjensen.github.io/flowgym/), including tutorials and API references.
