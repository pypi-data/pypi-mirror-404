## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - TBD

### Added
- **🚀 `oasr exec` command** — Execute skills as CLI tools from anywhere
  - Run skills with agent-driven execution: `oasr exec <skill> -p "prompt"`
  - Multiple prompt input methods: inline (`-p`), file (`-i`), or stdin (pipe)
  - Agent selection via flag (`--agent`) or config default
  - Graceful error handling with helpful guidance
- **`oasr config` command** — Manage OASR configuration
  - `config set <key> <value>` — Set config values (e.g., default agent)
  - `config get <key>` — Retrieve config values
  - `config list` — Display all configuration with agent availability
  - `config path` — Show config file location
- **`oasr clone` command** — Renamed from `oasr use` for clarity
  - Clones skills from registry to current directory
  - Same functionality as deprecated `oasr use`
- **Agent driver system** — Support for multiple AI agent CLIs
  - Codex: `codex exec "<prompt>"`
  - GitHub Copilot: `copilot -p "<prompt>"`
  - Claude CLI: `claude <prompt> -p`
  - OpenCode: `opencode run "<prompt>"`
  - Auto-detection of available agent binaries
  - Extensible driver architecture for adding new agents
- **Multi-skill repository support** — Detect and add multiple skills from one repo
  - `oasr registry add <repo-url>` automatically finds all SKILL.md files
  - Interactive prompt for bulk addition: "Found 3 skills. Add all? [Y/n]"
  - Each skill registered with proper subdirectory URL

### Changed
- **Config system refactored** — Moved to subpackage architecture
  - `src/config/` subpackage with schema validation
  - New `agent.default` field in config for default agent selection
  - TOML serialization improved (strips None values)

## [0.3.3] - 2026-01-30

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Adapters now inject tracking metadata when copying skills
  - Skills copied by `oasr adapter cursor`, `claude`, etc. now include `metadata.oasr`
  - Enables `oasr diff` and `oasr sync` to work with adapter-copied skills
  - Graceful degradation if manifest cannot be loaded

  - Added missing `-r/--recursive` flag to `registry add` and `registry rm`
  - Added missing `--strict` flag to `registry add`
  - Fixed `registry rm` argument name from `names` to `targets` (for glob pattern support)
  - Added missing `--quiet` flag to `registry rm`

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-30

### Added
- **Metadata tracking via frontmatter** — Skills now track their source via `metadata.oasr` field in SKILL.md
  - Eliminates need for external tracking files (.oasr directories)
  - Spec-compliant (Open Agent Skill metadata field)
  - Tracks: content hash, source path/URL, sync timestamp
- **`oasr diff` command** — Show status of tracked skills (up-to-date, outdated, modified, untracked)
- **`oasr sync` command** — Refresh outdated tracked skills from registry
- **`oasr registry` command** — New unified registry management
  - `oasr registry` (default) - Validate registry manifests
  - `oasr registry list` - List registered skills
  - `oasr registry add` - Add skills to registry
  - `oasr registry rm` - Remove skills from registry
  - `oasr registry sync` - Sync with remote repositories

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Complete CLI taxonomy redesign for clarity and flexibility
  - `oasr add` → `oasr registry add`
  - `oasr rm` → `oasr registry rm`
  - `oasr list` → `oasr registry list`
  - `oasr sync` → `oasr registry` (validation)
  - `oasr sync --update` → `oasr registry sync`
  - `oasr status` → `oasr registry -v`
- **BREAKING**: `oasr use` now injects tracking metadata automatically
- Skills copied locally now contain self-describing metadata for drift detection

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Removed standalone `add`, `rm`, `list`, `status` commands (moved to `registry` subcommand)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-30

  - `oasr add` now accepts GitHub/GitLab repository URLs
  - `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GITLAB_TOKEN` environment variable support for authentication

  - Automatic fetching and copying of remote skills during `adapter` and `use` operations
  - Smart caching to avoid redundant API calls
  - Graceful failure handling for rate limits and network errors
  - **Parallel fetching** — up to 4 concurrent remote skill downloads

- Glob pattern support for `oasr use` (e.g., `oasr use "git-*"`)
- **Copilot adapter** — generates `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with managed skill sections
- **Claude adapter** — generates `.claude/commands/*.md` files
- Cross-platform installation scripts: `install.sh` and `install.ps1`
  - Automatic migration from `~/.skills/` to `~/.oasr/`

  - Validation documentation moved to `docs/validation/`
  - Screenshots gallery in `docs/.images/`
  - Individual command pages with examples

- **BREAKING**: Data directory changed from `~/.skills/` to `~/.oasr/`
  - Automatic migration during installation
  - Preserves `~/.skills/` if other files exist
- `--copy` flag kept for backward compatibility but has no effect
- Skills are always copied to `.{ide}/skills/` directories for consistency
- Adapter files now use relative paths to local skill copies
- Remote skills fetch on-demand (not stored permanently after `oasr add`)
- Remote operations now show progress and fetch in parallel (3-4x faster)
- `oasr info` simplified to use positional argument (`oasr info <skill-name>`)
- `oasr list` output redesigned with box-drawing characters, shortened paths, and `--verbose` flag
- Renamed `src/oasr_cmd/` to `src/commands/` for clarity
- Packaging migrated to a `src/` layout
- Build backend migrated to Hatch (hatchling)
- CLI binary renamed to `oasr` (with `skills` kept as a compatibility alias)
- README rebranded to "OASR" (Open Agent Skill Registry)
- README simplified to focus on problem/solution; details moved to docs

### Fixed
- W002 validation warning no longer fires for remote skills during registration
- Remote reachability check now validates specific path, not just repository
- URL preservation in manifests (no longer mangled by Path conversion)
- Graceful handling of GitHub API rate limits (operations continue for other skills)
- Smart caching prevents redundant fetches during adapter operations
- Error messages now include helpful suggestions (e.g., "Try: oasr list")

### Performance
- **Parallel remote skill fetching** — 3-4x faster with multiple remote skills
- **Smart caching** — skip unchanged remote skills during adapter operations
- **Thread-safe operations** — concurrent downloads with proper synchronization

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-21

### Added
- Initial CLI with registry, discovery, validation, adapters, and manifests.
