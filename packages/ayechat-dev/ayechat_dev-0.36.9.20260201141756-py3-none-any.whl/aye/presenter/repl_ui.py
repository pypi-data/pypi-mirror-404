"""REPL UI presenter for Aye Chat.

This module contains small, purpose-built printing helpers used by the
interactive chat (REPL) interface.

Responsibilities:
- Define a Rich `Theme` for consistent colors across help/warnings/errors.
- Provide helper functions that render:
  - welcome/help messages
  - the prompt symbol
  - an assistant response block (Markdown inside a Panel)
  - status messages after file operations

Design notes:
- Most strings use Rich markup tags like `[ui.success]...[/]`.
  These tags refer to keys in `deep_ocean_theme`.
- The assistant response is rendered as Markdown so that bullet lists, code
  blocks, headers, etc. display nicely in the terminal.
