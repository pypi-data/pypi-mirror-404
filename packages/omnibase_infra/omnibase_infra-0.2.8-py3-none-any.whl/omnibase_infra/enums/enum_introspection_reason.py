Introspection Reason Enumeration.

Defines reason values for node introspection events, categorizing why a node
emits an introspection event for filtering, alerting, and analytics.

Thread Safety:
    All enums in this module are immutable and thread-safe.
    Enum values can be safely shared across threads without synchronization.

    Reasons why a node emits an introspection event.

    Used by ModelNodeIntrospectionEvent to categorize introspection
    events for filtering, alerting, and analytics.

    Values:
        STARTUP: Node just started and is announcing presence.
        SHUTDOWN: Node is gracefully shutting down.
        REQUEST: Explicit request for introspection (e.g., admin query).
        HEARTBEAT: Periodic health heartbeat.
        HEALTH_CHANGE: Node health status changed.
        CAPABILITY_CHANGE: Node capabilities changed at runtime.

    Example:
        >>> reason = EnumIntrospectionReason.STARTUP
        >>> reason.is_lifecycle_event()
        True
        >>> str(EnumIntrospectionReason.HEARTBEAT)
