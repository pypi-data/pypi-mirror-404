"""MCP contract configuration model for enabling nodes as MCP tools.

This model defines the `mcp` field that can be added to ONEX contracts to expose
orchestrator nodes as MCP tools for AI agent integration.

Example contract.yaml:
    node_type: ORCHESTRATOR_GENERIC
    mcp:
      expose: true
      tool_name: "workflow_execute"
      description: "Execute a workflow"
      timeout_seconds: 30

Enforcement Rule:
    The `mcp.expose` field is ONLY valid for ORCHESTRATOR_GENERIC nodes.
    Non-orchestrator nodes with `mcp.expose: true` will be ignored during
    registration - the MCP tags will not be added to Consul.

    """MCP configuration for exposing a node as an MCP tool.

    This configuration is embedded in a node's contract.yaml to enable
    AI agents to discover and invoke the node as an MCP tool.

    Attributes:
        expose: Whether to expose this node as an MCP tool. When True and
            the node is an orchestrator, it will be registered with Consul
            using MCP-specific tags for tool discovery.
        tool_name: Optional stable name for the MCP tool. If not provided,
            defaults to the node's name. Use this to provide a consistent
            tool name across node version changes.
        description: Optional AI-friendly description of what this tool does.
            If not provided, the node's description from the contract is used.
        timeout_seconds: Optional execution timeout in seconds. Defaults to 30.
            This is enforced when AI agents invoke the tool.

    Example:
        >>> config = ModelMCPContractConfig(
        ...     expose=True,
        ...     tool_name="my_workflow",
        ...     description="Execute my custom workflow",
        ...     timeout_seconds=60,
        ... )
        >>> config.expose
