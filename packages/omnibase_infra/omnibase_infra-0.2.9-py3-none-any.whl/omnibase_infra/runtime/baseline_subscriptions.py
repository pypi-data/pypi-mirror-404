"""Baseline Subscriptions Assembly Module.

Aggregates platform baseline topic constants from omnibase_core for use
by the ONEX runtime when wiring Kafka subscriptions.

Part of OMN-1696: Wire baseline topic constants from omnibase_core into
omnibase_infra runtime subscription assembly.

Platform Baseline Topics:
    These topics are automatically subscribed to by the runtime during
    initialization, providing core platform functionality:

    - **Contract Registered**: Notifies when a new handler contract is registered.
      Used by KafkaContractSource for dynamic contract discovery.

    - **Contract Deregistered**: Notifies when a handler contract is removed.
      Used by KafkaContractSource for cache invalidation.

    - **Node Heartbeat**: Periodic health signals from running nodes.
      Used for liveness monitoring and service discovery.

Usage:
    >>> from omnibase_infra.runtime.baseline_subscriptions import (
    ...     BASELINE_CONTRACT_TOPICS,
    ...     BASELINE_PLATFORM_TOPICS,
    ...     get_baseline_topics,
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> # Get contract-only topics (registration/deregistration)
    >>> contract_topics = get_baseline_topics(include_heartbeat=False)
    >>>
    >>> # Get all platform baseline topics (including heartbeat)
    >>> all_topics = get_baseline_topics(include_heartbeat=True)

    This helper function provides a convenient way to select between
    the full platform topic set or contract-only topics based on
    runtime requirements.

    Args:
        include_heartbeat: If True (default), returns all platform baseline
            topics including node heartbeat. If False, returns only contract
            registration/deregistration topics.

    Returns:
        A frozenset of topic suffix strings. These are suffixes that should
        be prefixed with the environment name to form complete topic names.

    Example:
        >>> # For full platform observability
        >>> topics = get_baseline_topics(include_heartbeat=True)
        >>> assert TOPIC_SUFFIX_NODE_HEARTBEAT in topics

        >>> assert TOPIC_SUFFIX_NODE_HEARTBEAT not in topics
        >>> assert TOPIC_SUFFIX_CONTRACT_REGISTERED in topics

    Note:
        The returned frozenset is immutable and can be safely shared
        across threads without synchronization.
