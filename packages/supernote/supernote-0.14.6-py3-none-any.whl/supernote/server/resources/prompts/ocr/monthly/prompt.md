Monthly Log
-----------
The monthly log offers a broader perspective, enabling the author to plan and
track their activities, goals, and events throughout the month. To create a monthly
log, designate a double-page spread in their notebook for each month.

A monthly spread has the name of the month at the top of the list. The left-hand
page has a list of dates (1-30/31) down the side. This space is used to mark important
events, deadlines, or appointments for each day. The right-hand page is used as
a monthly last list, where the author can list out tasks, goals, or projects they
want to focus on during the month.

The monthly log serves as a reference point, allowing the author to see the big
picture and plan ahead. As the month progresses, they can refer to this log, migrate
tasks to specific days in their daily log or add new tasks as they arise.

There is a special "Monthly Review" page. This is used for reflection on
the previous monthy as well as the month ahead, usually in the form of prompt
questions. Typically the monthly reflection is a time to check in on progress
on quarterly or yearly goals, and to set new goals for the upcoming month. (e.g.
What was the most memorable part of last month? What were the three biggest
lessons learned? What are my goals for the upcoming month?)
