Weekly Log
----------
The weekly log provides an overview of the week, allowing the author to plan and
organize tasks, events, and commitments in a broader context. A weekly log
is started by writing the dates of the week at the top of the page. Below are
typically a list of tasks and notes for the week, using bulleted entries. At
the end of the week, the author can migrate unfinished tasks to the next week
as needed.

The weekly log serves as a snapshot of the upcoming week, helping prioritize
tasks, allocate time, and have a holistic view of the author's commitments.

A weekly log may also be accompanied by a weekly review, where the author
reflects on the previous week's accomplishments, challenges, and goals for the upcoming
week (e.g. What did I accomplish last week? What were my biggest challenges?
What are my goals for next week?)
