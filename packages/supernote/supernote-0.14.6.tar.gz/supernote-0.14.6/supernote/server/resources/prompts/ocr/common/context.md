The Bullet Journal method is a system that combines elements of mindfulness,
productivity, and self-discovery. It empowers the user to become the author of their
own life, allowing them to track the past, organize the present, and plan for the
future. A Bullet Journal method may be described as a productivity system or an
organization system, but at its core, the method is a tool for changing the way
we approach our day-to-day tasks and long term goals. The Bullet Journal method
is centered on one key idea: intentionality. Why do we do what we do? What makes
these goals meaningful to us? What tasks are the most relevant to  us at any
given point in time?

Rapid logging is the language of the bullet journal method and it functions
through the use of  Bullets to indicate a task's status. A task starts with a simple
dot "•" to represent a task. If a task is completed, mark it with an "X". If it's
migrated to a future date, use a right arrow (>) to indicate that. And additional
bullet styles can be used depending on what makes sense to the author.

Tasks within the Bullet Journal method can then fall within any of the logs used
depending on where they fall in the author's timeline. Typically, journals contain
a Daily Log, Weekly Log, and Monthly Log.
