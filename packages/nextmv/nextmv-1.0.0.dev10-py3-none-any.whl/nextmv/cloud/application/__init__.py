    You can import the `Application` class directly from `cloud`:

    ```python

    This class represents an application in Nextmv Cloud, providing methods to
    interact with the application, run it with different inputs, manage versions,
    instances, experiments, and more.

    Note: It is recommended to use `Application.get()` or `Application.new()`
    instead of direct initialization to ensure proper setup.

        Push an app to Nextmv Cloud.

        If the manifest is not provided, an `app.yaml` file will be searched
        for in the provided path. If there is no manifest file found, an
        exception will be raised.

        There are two ways to push an app to Nextmv Cloud:
        1. Specifying `app_dir`, which is the path to an app's root directory.
        This acts as an external strategy, where the app is composed of files
        in a directory and those apps are packaged and pushed to Nextmv Cloud.
        2. Specifying a `model` and `model_configuration`. This acts as an
        internal (or Python-native) strategy, where the app is actually a
        `nextmv.Model`. The model is encoded, some dependencies and
        accompanying files are packaged, and the app is pushed to Nextmv Cloud.

        Parameters
        ----------
        manifest : Optional[Manifest], default=None
            The manifest for the app. If None, an `app.yaml` file in the provided
            app directory will be used.
        app_dir : Optional[str], default=None
            The path to the app's root directory. If None, the current directory
            will be used. This is for the external strategy approach.
        verbose : bool, default=False
            Whether to print verbose output during the push process.
        model : Optional[Model], default=None
            The Python-native model to push. Must be specified together with
            `model_configuration`. This is for the internal strategy approach.
        model_configuration : Optional[ModelConfiguration], default=None
            Configuration for the Python-native model. Must be specified together
            with `model`.
        rich_print : bool, default=False
            Whether to use rich printing when verbose output is enabled.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If neither app_dir nor model/model_configuration is provided correctly,
            or if only one of model and model_configuration is provided.
        TypeError
            If model is not an instance of nextmv.Model or if model_configuration
            is not an instance of nextmv.ModelConfiguration.
        Exception
            If there's an error in the build, packaging, or cleanup process.

        Examples
        --------
        1. Push an app using an external strategy (directory-based):

        >>> app.push()  # Use verbose=True for step-by-step output.

        2. Push an app using an internal strategy (Python-native model):

        json_configurations : Optional[dict[str, Any]], default=None
            Optional configurations for JSON serialization. If provided, these
