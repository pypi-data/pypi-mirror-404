class PollingOptions:
    """
    Options to use when polling for a run result.

    You can import the `PollingOptions` class directly from `nextmv`:

    ```python
    from nextmv import PollingOptions
    ```

    The Cloud API will be polled for the result. The polling stops if:

    * The maximum number of polls (tries) are exhausted. This is specified by
      the `max_tries` parameter.
    * The maximum duration of the polling strategy is reached. This is
      specified by the `max_duration` parameter.

    Before conducting the first poll, the `initial_delay` is used to sleep.
    After each poll, a sleep duration is calculated using the following
    strategy, based on exponential backoff with jitter:

    ```
    sleep_duration = min(`max_delay`, `delay` + `backoff` * 2 ** i + Uniform(0, `jitter`))
    ```

    Where:
    * i is the retry (poll) number.
    * Uniform is the uniform distribution.

    Note that the sleep duration is capped by the `max_delay` parameter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    backoff : float, default=0.9
        Exponential backoff factor, in seconds, to use between polls.
    delay : float, default=0.1
        Base delay to use between polls, in seconds.
    initial_delay : float, default=1.0
        Initial delay to use before starting the polling strategy, in seconds.
    max_delay : float, default=20.0
        Maximum delay to use between polls, in seconds.
    max_duration : float, default=300.0
        Maximum duration of the polling strategy, in seconds.
    max_tries : int, default=100
        Maximum number of tries to use.
    jitter : float, default=1.0
        Jitter to use for the polling strategy. A uniform distribution is sampled
        between 0 and this number. The resulting random number is added to the
        delay for each poll, adding a random noise. Set this to 0 to avoid using
        random jitter.
    verbose : bool, default=False
        Whether to log the polling strategy. This is useful for debugging.
    stop : callable, default=None
        Function to call to check if the polling should stop. This is useful for
        stopping the polling based on external conditions. The function should
        return True to stop the polling and False to continue. The function does
        not receive any arguments. The function is called before each poll.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from nextmv.cloud import PollingOptions
    >>> # Create polling options with custom settings

    ...     max_tries=50,

    Poll a function until it succeeds or the polling strategy is exhausted.

    You can import the `poll` function directly from `nextmv`:

    ```python
    from nextmv import poll
    ```

    This function implements a flexible polling strategy with exponential backoff
    and jitter. It calls the provided polling function repeatedly until it indicates
    success, the maximum number of tries is reached, or the maximum duration is exceeded.

    The `polling_func` is a callable that must return a `tuple[Any, bool]`
    where the first element is the result of the polling and the second
    element is a boolean indicating if the polling was successful or should be
    retried.

    Parameters
    ----------
    polling_options : PollingOptions
        Options for configuring the polling behavior, including retry counts,
        delays, timeouts, and verbosity settings.
    polling_func : callable
        Function to call to check if the polling was successful. Must return a tuple
        where the first element is the result value and the second is a boolean
        indicating success (True) or need to retry (False).

    Returns
    -------
    Any
        Result value from the polling function when successful.

    Raises
    ------
    TimeoutError
        If the polling exceeds the maximum duration specified in polling_options.
    RuntimeError
        If the maximum number of tries is exhausted without success.

    Examples
    --------
