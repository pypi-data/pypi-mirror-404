"""Classes for working with Nextmv Cloud Instances.

This module provides classes for interacting with instances in Nextmv Cloud.
It defines the core data structures for both instance configuration and the
instance itself.

Classes
-------
InstanceConfiguration
    Configuration settings for a Nextmv Cloud instance.
Instance
    Representation of a Nextmv Cloud instance tied to an application version.

    This class represents the configuration settings that can be applied to a

    Parameters
    ----------

        ID of the secrets collection to use with this instance.
    queuing : RunQueuing, optional
        Queuing configuration for the instance.

    You can import the `Instance` class directly from `cloud`:

    ```python

    A Nextmv Cloud instance represents a deployable configuration of an application
    version. Instances have their own unique identity and can be used to run jobs
    with specific configurations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    id : str
        The unique identifier of the instance.
    application_id : str
        ID of the application that this instance belongs to.
    version_id : str
        ID of the application version this instance uses.
    name : str
        Human-readable name of the instance.
    description : str
        Detailed description of the instance.
    configuration : InstanceConfiguration
        Configuration settings for this instance.
    locked : bool
        Whether the instance is locked for modifications.
    created_at : datetime
        Timestamp when the instance was created.
    updated_at : datetime
        Timestamp when the instance was last updated.
