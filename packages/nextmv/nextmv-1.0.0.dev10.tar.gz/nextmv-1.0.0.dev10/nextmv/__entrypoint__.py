"""
When working in a notebook environment, we don't really create a `main.py` file
with the main entrypoint of the program. Because the logic is mostly encoded
inside the `Model` class, we need to create a `main.py` file that we can run in
Nextmv Cloud. This file is used as that entrypoint. It is not intended for a
human to use it during local development. It is the standard way in which a
`nextmv.Model` is loaded by using mlflow.
