/// determined by blending the skinning transforms (using LBS).

/// the location of points on e.g. the shoulder is more accurately modeled by blending
/// multiple transforms.  In addition, the locator can be constrained to slide along the
/// surface of the mesh using e.g. the SkinnedLocatorTriangleErrorFunction.

/// on a character, defining constraints, or serving as targets for inverse kinematics.
