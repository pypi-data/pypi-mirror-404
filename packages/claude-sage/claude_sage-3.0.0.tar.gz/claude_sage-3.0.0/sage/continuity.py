"""Session continuity via compaction detection.

Provides marker-based continuity across Claude Code compaction events.
When compaction is detected (via watcher), a marker is written pointing
to the most recent checkpoint. On the next sage tool call, context is
injected automatically.

Flow:
1. 70% context hook saves checkpoint (existing)
2. Compaction watcher detects isCompactSummary in JSONL
3. Watcher calls mark_for_continuity()
4. Next sage tool call: _maybe_inject_continuity() injects and clears

Security:
- Marker file has restricted permissions (0o600)
- Paths are validated before use
- JSON parsing uses safe_load equivalent (json.loads)
