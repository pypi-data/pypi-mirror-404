> [!TIP]
> ### Pro Tips: 

- You can use Tab for autocomplete.
- Navigate the terminal efficiently: arrow keys, backspace, delete ...
- Use custom `@tags` to organize tasks
- You can execute multiple commands at once:
    - all - apply the command to all items

    - id-id – apply the command to a range of IDs

    - id1 id2 id3 – apply the command to specific IDs

### examples:

```
done all       # marks all tasks as done
done 4-7       # marks tasks with IDs 4 through 7 as done
done 3 5 8     # marks tasks 3, 5, and 8 as done
```

## ❓ FAQ

### Where are the saved todo files stored?

#### You can simply check it by running `todol --path`

`todol` stores its data using `platformdirs.user_data_dir`, which means files are written to the standard user data directory for each operating system.

#### Default locations

- **Linux**
`~/.local/share/todol/todoFiles/`

- **macOS**
`~/Library/Application Support/todol/todoFiles/`

- **Windows**
`%APPDATA%\todol\todoFiles\`
