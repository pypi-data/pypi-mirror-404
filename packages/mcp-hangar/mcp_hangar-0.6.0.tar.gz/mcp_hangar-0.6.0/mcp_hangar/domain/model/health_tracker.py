    This is a mutable entity (not a value object) that encapsulates
    health-related business logic including:
    - Failure counting and threshold detection
    - Backoff calculation for retry logic
    - Success/failure recording with timestamps

    Note:
        This class is intentionally mutable as it tracks state over time.

    Example:

        >>> tracker.consecutive_failures
