    Agilicus API

    Agilicus is API-first. Modern software is controlled by other software, is open, is available for you to use the way you want, securely, simply.  The OpenAPI Specification in YAML format is available on [www](https://www.agilicus.com/www/api/agilicus-openapi.yaml) for importing to other tools.  A rendered, online viewable and usable version of this specification is available at [api](https://www.agilicus.com/api). You may try the API inline directly in the web page. To do so, first obtain an Authentication Token (the simplest way is to install the Python SDK, and then run `agilicus-cli --issuer https://MYISSUER get-token`). You will need an org-id for most calls (and can obtain from `agilicus-cli --issuer https://MYISSUER list-orgs`). The `MYISSUER` will typically be `auth.MYDOMAIN`, and you will see it as you sign-in to the administrative UI.  This API releases on Bearer-Token authentication. To obtain a valid bearer token you will need to Authenticate to an Issuer with OpenID Connect (a superset of OAUTH2).  Your \"issuer\" will look like https://auth.MYDOMAIN. For example, when you signed-up, if you said \"use my own domain name\" and assigned a CNAME of cloud.example.com, then your issuer would be https://auth.cloud.example.com.  If you selected \"use an Agilicus supplied domain name\", your issuer would look like https://auth.myorg.agilicus.cloud.  For test purposes you can use our [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/agilicus/) and run `agilicus-cli --issuer https://auth.MYDOMAIN get-token`.  This API may be used in any language runtime that supports OpenAPI 3.0, or, you may use our [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/agilicus/), our [Typescript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agilicus/angular), or our [Golang SDK](https://git.agilicus.com/pub/sdk-go).  100% of the activities in our system our API-driven, from our web-admin, through our progressive web applications, to all internals: there is nothing that is not accessible.  For more information, see [developer resources](https://www.agilicus.com/developer).   # noqa: E501

            name (str): A descriptive name for the destination. This will be used in reporting and diagnostics. 
            org_id (str): Unique identifier
            destination_type (str): The type of the destination. This controls how events are sent to the destination. This can be set to the following values:  - `file`: A file destination. The url is the path to a file on disk where events will be logged. The log format is JSONL. The log file is rotated. Old rotations are placed in the same directory as the log file. - `webhook`: A webhook destination. The url is points to an http server which will accept POSTs of an    AuditWebhookEvent object. The server should respond with an HTTP 2XX return code on success. The   event should be handled as a transaction: either all events are processed, or none. An HTTP 429   in conjunction with a Retry-After header may be used to tell the audit agent to back off. An HTTP   400 will instruct the audit agent to discard all of the events. - `graylog`: A graylog destination. The location points to a graylog server. - `syslog`: A syslog destination. The location points to a syslog server. - `connector`: A connector destination. The location points to a particular connector (connector_id) 
            location (str): The location of the destination. The meaning of the location changes based on the destination type.  - `file`: A URL of the path to the file on the local system. The URL should be of the form `file:///path/to/file`.    On Windows this can be `/drive/path/to/file`.  If the path is relative (`file://./path/to/file`), the relative path is    rooted at the directory from which the evnet source is running. 
            comment (str): A short comment describing the purpose of the destination. This is only used for informational purposes.
