    Agilicus API

    Agilicus is API-first. Modern software is controlled by other software, is open, is available for you to use the way you want, securely, simply.  The OpenAPI Specification in YAML format is available on [www](https://www.agilicus.com/www/api/agilicus-openapi.yaml) for importing to other tools.  A rendered, online viewable and usable version of this specification is available at [api](https://www.agilicus.com/api). You may try the API inline directly in the web page. To do so, first obtain an Authentication Token (the simplest way is to install the Python SDK, and then run `agilicus-cli --issuer https://MYISSUER get-token`). You will need an org-id for most calls (and can obtain from `agilicus-cli --issuer https://MYISSUER list-orgs`). The `MYISSUER` will typically be `auth.MYDOMAIN`, and you will see it as you sign-in to the administrative UI.  This API releases on Bearer-Token authentication. To obtain a valid bearer token you will need to Authenticate to an Issuer with OpenID Connect (a superset of OAUTH2).  Your \"issuer\" will look like https://auth.MYDOMAIN. For example, when you signed-up, if you said \"use my own domain name\" and assigned a CNAME of cloud.example.com, then your issuer would be https://auth.cloud.example.com.  If you selected \"use an Agilicus supplied domain name\", your issuer would look like https://auth.myorg.agilicus.cloud.  For test purposes you can use our [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/agilicus/) and run `agilicus-cli --issuer https://auth.MYDOMAIN get-token`.  This API may be used in any language runtime that supports OpenAPI 3.0, or, you may use our [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/agilicus/), our [Typescript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agilicus/angular), or our [Golang SDK](https://git.agilicus.com/pub/sdk-go).  100% of the activities in our system our API-driven, from our web-admin, through our progressive web applications, to all internals: there is nothing that is not accessible.  For more information, see [developer resources](https://www.agilicus.com/developer).   # noqa: E501

            connections_tls_protocol_failure (int): The number of times a connection attempt failed because the upstream returned an invalid TLS response. Typically this happens because the upstream is not configured to use TLS, but it could be due to a bug in the upstream server, or some other incompatibility (e.g. an unsupported version whose versioning mechanism is unknown). Check that the server is configured to serve TLS, or connect to it using plaintext. . [optional]  # noqa: E501
            connections_tls_unsupported_version (int): The number of times a connection attempt failed because the upstream server replied that it did not support one of the versions supported by the client. Typically this is because the server is running a fairly old version of software. See if there is a new version of the software available, or ensure that it provides a maximum TLS version of at least 1.2. . [optional]  # noqa: E501
            connections_tls_remote_error (int): The number of times a connection attempt failed because the upstream server replied that it was unable to accept the connection request. This can be for various reasons such as an incompatible set of cipher suites. Check that the server supports a modern set of cipher suites, or look at its logs to see if it indicates the reason for the failure. . [optional]  # noqa: E501
            connections_tls_other_error (int): The number of times a connection attempt failed because the TLS negotiation failed for reasons other than the explicitly enumerated ones. . [optional]  # noqa: E501

            _configuration (Configuration): the instance to use when
                                deserializing a file_type parameter.
                                If passed, type conversion is attempted
                                If omitted no type conversion is done.
            _visited_composed_classes (tuple): This stores a tuple of
                                classes that we have traveled through so that
                                if we see that class again we will not use its
                                discriminator again.
                                When traveling through a discriminator, the
                                composed schema that is
                                is traveled through is added to this set.
                                For example if Animal has a discriminator
                                petType and we pass in "Dog", and the class Dog
                                allOf includes Animal, we move through Animal
                                once using the discriminator, and pick Dog.
                                Then in Dog, we will make an instance of the
                                Animal class but this time we won't travel
                                through its discriminator because we passed in
                                _visited_composed_classes = (Animal,)
            connections_tls_protocol_failure (int): The number of times a connection attempt failed because the upstream returned an invalid TLS response. Typically this happens because the upstream is not configured to use TLS, but it could be due to a bug in the upstream server, or some other incompatibility (e.g. an unsupported version whose versioning mechanism is unknown). Check that the server is configured to serve TLS, or connect to it using plaintext. . [optional]  # noqa: E501
            connections_tls_unsupported_version (int): The number of times a connection attempt failed because the upstream server replied that it did not support one of the versions supported by the client. Typically this is because the server is running a fairly old version of software. See if there is a new version of the software available, or ensure that it provides a maximum TLS version of at least 1.2. . [optional]  # noqa: E501
            connections_tls_remote_error (int): The number of times a connection attempt failed because the upstream server replied that it was unable to accept the connection request. This can be for various reasons such as an incompatible set of cipher suites. Check that the server supports a modern set of cipher suites, or look at its logs to see if it indicates the reason for the failure. . [optional]  # noqa: E501
            connections_tls_other_error (int): The number of times a connection attempt failed because the TLS negotiation failed for reasons other than the explicitly enumerated ones. . [optional]  # noqa: E501
            datagrams_too_large_sent (int): The number of times we failed to send a datagram to a network because it was too large (e.g. above MTU) . [optional]  # noqa: E501
            datagrams_too_large_received (int): The number of times we failed to receive a datagram to a network because it was too large (e.g. above MTU) . [optional]  # noqa: E501
