    Agilicus API

    Agilicus is API-first. Modern software is controlled by other software, is open, is available for you to use the way you want, securely, simply.  The OpenAPI Specification in YAML format is available on [www](https://www.agilicus.com/www/api/agilicus-openapi.yaml) for importing to other tools.  A rendered, online viewable and usable version of this specification is available at [api](https://www.agilicus.com/api). You may try the API inline directly in the web page. To do so, first obtain an Authentication Token (the simplest way is to install the Python SDK, and then run `agilicus-cli --issuer https://MYISSUER get-token`). You will need an org-id for most calls (and can obtain from `agilicus-cli --issuer https://MYISSUER list-orgs`). The `MYISSUER` will typically be `auth.MYDOMAIN`, and you will see it as you sign-in to the administrative UI.  This API releases on Bearer-Token authentication. To obtain a valid bearer token you will need to Authenticate to an Issuer with OpenID Connect (a superset of OAUTH2).  Your \"issuer\" will look like https://auth.MYDOMAIN. For example, when you signed-up, if you said \"use my own domain name\" and assigned a CNAME of cloud.example.com, then your issuer would be https://auth.cloud.example.com.  If you selected \"use an Agilicus supplied domain name\", your issuer would look like https://auth.myorg.agilicus.cloud.  For test purposes you can use our [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/agilicus/) and run `agilicus-cli --issuer https://auth.MYDOMAIN get-token`.  This API may be used in any language runtime that supports OpenAPI 3.0, or, you may use our [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/agilicus/), our [Typescript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agilicus/angular), or our [Golang SDK](https://git.agilicus.com/pub/sdk-go).  100% of the activities in our system our API-driven, from our web-admin, through our progressive web applications, to all internals: there is nothing that is not accessible.  For more information, see [developer resources](https://www.agilicus.com/developer).   # noqa: E501

                                are pythonic names, e.g. snake case (default)
            _configuration (Configuration): the instance to use when

                                For example if Animal has a discriminator
                                petType and we pass in "Dog", and the class Dog
                                allOf includes Animal, we move through Animal

                                Animal class but this time we won't travel
                                through its discriminator because we passed in

            auto_renew (bool): When enabled (true), system will automatically renew the certificate using the provided request CSR.  The resulting certificate will be updated in CertSigningReqCertificateStatus. . [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of True  # noqa: E501
            rotate_keys (bool): Provided as a mechansim to notify a user/client to rotate their keys. A client would retrieve this and the client would then issue a new request. A subsequent PUT with a new request will reset this property to false. This may be true whereby a user has decided to update all keys, and this facility could be made available via the administration portal. . [optional]  # noqa: E501

            target_issuer (str): The name of the issuing certificate authority. This value chooses which certificate authority approves the CSR and issues the certificate. Choose this value carefully, as the chosen issuer affects which chain of trust will be used to validate the certificate.  If this value is not provided, it defaults to `agilicus-public-acme`.  Options:   - `agilicus-public-acme`: The certificate is requested from a public certificate authority   using the ACME protocol.
