    Agilicus API

    Agilicus is API-first. Modern software is controlled by other software, is open, is available for you to use the way you want, securely, simply.  The OpenAPI Specification in YAML format is available on [www](https://www.agilicus.com/www/api/agilicus-openapi.yaml) for importing to other tools.  A rendered, online viewable and usable version of this specification is available at [api](https://www.agilicus.com/api). You may try the API inline directly in the web page. To do so, first obtain an Authentication Token (the simplest way is to install the Python SDK, and then run `agilicus-cli --issuer https://MYISSUER get-token`). You will need an org-id for most calls (and can obtain from `agilicus-cli --issuer https://MYISSUER list-orgs`). The `MYISSUER` will typically be `auth.MYDOMAIN`, and you will see it as you sign-in to the administrative UI.  This API releases on Bearer-Token authentication. To obtain a valid bearer token you will need to Authenticate to an Issuer with OpenID Connect (a superset of OAUTH2).  Your \"issuer\" will look like https://auth.MYDOMAIN. For example, when you signed-up, if you said \"use my own domain name\" and assigned a CNAME of cloud.example.com, then your issuer would be https://auth.cloud.example.com.  If you selected \"use an Agilicus supplied domain name\", your issuer would look like https://auth.myorg.agilicus.cloud.  For test purposes you can use our [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/agilicus/) and run `agilicus-cli --issuer https://auth.MYDOMAIN get-token`.  This API may be used in any language runtime that supports OpenAPI 3.0, or, you may use our [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/agilicus/), our [Typescript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agilicus/angular), or our [Golang SDK](https://git.agilicus.com/pub/sdk-go).  100% of the activities in our system our API-driven, from our web-admin, through our progressive web applications, to all internals: there is nothing that is not accessible.  For more information, see [developer resources](https://www.agilicus.com/developer).   # noqa: E501

The user can deny the challenge via this     mechanism as well.   - web_push: a `web_push` challenge informs the user of the challenge on every device they have   registered via the web push (rfc8030) mechanism.

The user can deny the challenge via this   mechanism as well.   - totp: a time-based one-time password challenge allows the user to enter the code from their registered   - webauthn: a challenge issued for a specific device the user has possession of. Either a yubikey, or a phone that has a Trusted Platform Module.   device and application.   - one_time_use_action: a challenge whose acceptance or rejection takes an action on behalf of a user. Typically this is used   when wanting to respond to events through a messaging platform.   - code: a one time use challenge which may be redeemed through a code. This code is typically shared to the user who copies it from one machine   to another. This is a variation of web_push where, instead of sending the code via webpush, the caller runs their own protocol to communicate it.   The same answer mechanism (a link) is used. enum: [sms, web_push, totp, webauthn, one_time_use_action, code] example: web_push . [optional]  # noqa: E501
            challenge_types ([str]): List of acceptable challenge types for this challenge request. The subsequent challenge answer must be one of these types.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            send_now (bool): Whether to send the challenge now. If the challenge hasn't yet been set, setting this to true will send the challenge. If the challenge has been sent, changing this has no effect. . [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of False  # noqa: E501
            timeout_seconds (int): For how long the system will accept answers for the challenge. After this time, if the challenge is not in the `challenge_passed` state, it will transition into the `timed_out` state. . [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of 600  # noqa: E501
            response_uri (str): The base URI which the user should retrieve in order to answer the challenge. It is expected that this will be an HTTP endpoint serving `text/html` content. The final URI that the user should retrieve will be this value, extended with three form parameters that may be used to invoke the `answer` endpoint.   - challenge_answer: A string which is the answer code.   - challenge_uid: the id of the user being challenged.   - challenge_id: the id of the challenge. In the example, this would turn into something like: `https://auth.egov.city/mfa-answer?challenge_answer=supersecret&challenge_uid=1234&challenge_id=5678` . [optional]  # noqa: E501
            origin (str): The origin that is initiating the challenge.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            challenge_endpoints ([ChallengeEndpoint]): List of endpoint ids to challenge for this challenge request. At least one entry is required here when the challenge type includes webauthn.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            answer_data ({str: (bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type)}): An object containing an arbitrary set of data for this challenge. This value will be provided as-is when the challenge is answered. This is useful for when you want to convey information over the challenge in a one-time use fashion. E.g. perhaps you have a secret and some extra information about it. They can be packaged up in this. Note that it is unstructured so that it can be used for any usecase, as long as the two sides of the challenge agree on the format.  Note that it this data will not be present in the response: it is write only. This is so that it may be used as a secret which may only be claimed by the providing challenge answer. .

The same answer mechanism (a link) is used. enum: [sms, web_push, totp, webauthn, one_time_use_action, code] example: web_push . [optional]  # noqa: E501
            challenge_types ([str]): List of acceptable challenge types for this challenge request. The subsequent challenge answer must be one of these types.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            send_now (bool): Whether to send the challenge now. If the challenge hasn't yet been set, setting this to true will send the challenge. If the challenge has been sent, changing this has no effect. . [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of False  # noqa: E501
            timeout_seconds (int): For how long the system will accept answers for the challenge. After this time, if the challenge is not in the `challenge_passed` state, it will transition into the `timed_out` state. . [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of 600  # noqa: E501
            response_uri (str): The base URI which the user should retrieve in order to answer the challenge. It is expected that this will be an HTTP endpoint serving `text/html` content. The final URI that the user should retrieve will be this value, extended with three form parameters that may be used to invoke the `answer` endpoint.   - challenge_answer: A string which is the answer code.   - challenge_uid: the id of the user being challenged.   - challenge_id: the id of the challenge. In the example, this would turn into something like: `https://auth.egov.city/mfa-answer?challenge_answer=supersecret&challenge_uid=1234&challenge_id=5678` . [optional]  # noqa: E501
            origin (str): The origin that is initiating the challenge.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            challenge_endpoints ([ChallengeEndpoint]): List of endpoint ids to challenge for this challenge request. At least one entry is required here when the challenge type includes webauthn.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            answer_data ({str: (bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type)}): An object containing an arbitrary set of data for this challenge. This value will be provided as-is when the challenge is answered. This is useful for when you want to convey information over the challenge in a one-time use fashion. E.g. perhaps you have a secret and some extra information about it. They can be packaged up in this. Note that it is unstructured so that it can be used for any usecase, as long as the two sides of the challenge agree on the format.  Note that it this data will not be present in the response: it is write only. This is so that it may be used as a secret which may only be claimed by the providing challenge answer. .
