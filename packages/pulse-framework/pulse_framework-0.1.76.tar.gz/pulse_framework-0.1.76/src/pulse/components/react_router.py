	"""Client-side navigation link using react-router.

	Renders an anchor tag that performs client-side navigation without a full
	page reload. Supports prefetching and various navigation behaviors.

	Args:
		*children: Content to render inside the link.
		key: React reconciliation key.
		to: The target URL path (e.g., "/dashboard", "/users/123").
		discover: Route discovery behavior. "render" discovers on render,
			"none" disables discovery.
		prefetch: Prefetch strategy. "intent" (default) prefetches on hover/focus,
			"render" prefetches immediately, "viewport" when visible, "none" disables.
		preventScrollReset: If True, prevents scroll position reset on navigation.
		relative: Path resolution mode. "route" resolves relative to route hierarchy,
			"path" resolves relative to URL path.
		reloadDocument: If True, performs a full page navigation instead of SPA.
		replace: If True, replaces current history entry instead of pushing.
		state: Arbitrary state to pass to the destination location.
		viewTransition: If True, enables View Transitions API for the navigation.
		**props: Additional HTML anchor attributes (className, onClick, etc.).

	Example:
		Basic navigation::

			ps.Link(to="/dashboard")["Go to Dashboard"]

		With prefetching disabled::

			ps.Link(to="/settings", prefetch="none")["Settings"]

	Outlet is used in parent route components to render their child routes.

	Example:
		Layout with outlet for child routes::

			@ps.component
			def Layout():
				return ps.div(
					ps.nav("Navigation"),
					ps.Outlet(),  # Child route renders here
