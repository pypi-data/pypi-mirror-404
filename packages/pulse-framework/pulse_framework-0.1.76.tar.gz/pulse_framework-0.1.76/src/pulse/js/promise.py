JavaScript Promise builtin module.

Usage:

```python
from pulse.js import Promise
Promise(executor)             # -> new Promise(executor)
Promise.resolve(value)        # -> Promise.resolve(value)
Promise.reject(reason)        # -> Promise.reject(reason)

# Or import from module directly:
from pulse.js.promise import Promise
```

The `Promise` class is generic and supports async/await via the Awaitable protocol.
