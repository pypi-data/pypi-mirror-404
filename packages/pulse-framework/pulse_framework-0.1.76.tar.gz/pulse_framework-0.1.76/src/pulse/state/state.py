	Metaclass that automatically converts annotated attributes into reactive properties.

	When a class uses StateMeta (via inheriting from State), the metaclass:

	1. Converts all public type-annotated attributes into StateProperty descriptors
	2. Converts all public non-callable values into StateProperty descriptors
	3. Skips private attributes (starting with '_')
	4. Preserves existing descriptors (StateProperty, ComputedProperty, StateEffect)

	This enables the declarative state definition pattern:

	Example:

	```python
	class MyState(ps.State):
	    count: int = 0        # Becomes StateProperty
	    name: str = "test"    # Becomes StateProperty
	    _private: int = 0     # Stays as regular attribute (not reactive)

	    @ps.computed
	    def doubled(self):    # Becomes ComputedProperty
	        return self.count * 2
