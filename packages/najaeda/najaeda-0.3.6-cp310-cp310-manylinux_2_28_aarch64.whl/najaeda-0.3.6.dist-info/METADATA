najaeda Python Package
=======================

najaeda is a Python package that provides data structures and APIs for developing post-synthesis Electronic Design Automation (EDA) algorithms.

najaeda provides a powerful yet simple framework designed to help software
and hardware developers efficiently navigate and manipulate electronic
design automation (EDA) workflows.

With najaeda, you can:

* Explore Netlists with Ease:

  * Navigate netlist hierarchy and connectivity effortlessly.
  * Browse at multiple levels of detail:

    * Bit-level or bus-level granularity.
    * Instance-by-instance exploration or flattened views at the primitives level.
    * Localized per-instance connections or comprehensive equipotential views.

* Perform ECO (Engineering Change Order) Transformations:

  * Seamlessly apply and manage changes to your designs.

* Prototype EDA Ideas Quickly:

  * Use an intuitive API to experiment with new EDA concepts and workflows.

* Develop Custom EDA Tools:

  * Build fast, tailored tools for solving specific challenges without relying on costly, proprietary EDA software.

najaeda empowers developers to innovate, adapt, and accelerate their EDA
processes with minimal overhead.

najaeda is the Python counterpart of the `Naja C++ project <https://github.com/najaeda/naja>`_.
