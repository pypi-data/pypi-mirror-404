So you will see a bit different performance between Risk Neutralized metrics and actual Risk Neutralization settings (in particular turnover won’t change in the Risk Neutralized metrics but normal Risk Neutralization settings can affect it).</p><p>In your Alphas optimization process or Alpha submission selections, you should rank Alphas by the ratio between Risk Neutralized Metrics' sharpe and original Alpha sharpe or between Risk Neutralized Metrics' returns and original Alpha returns and choose the one with higher ratio. An Alpha that retains more of its performance after Risk Neutralization means it's less susceptible to risk factors’ drawdown &amp; volatility and maybe less correlated too.</p>",
