While an alpha can incorporate data fields from multiple datasets, this approach if not implemented correctly, may potentially lead to overfitting due to the mixing of conflicting signals between datasets.</p><p>In contrast, single dataset Alphas maintain homogeneity by using data from only one dataset, making them less prone to overfitting and more robust in their predictions.</p><p><b>Single Dataset Alpha Expression Properties</b></p><ol><li>Single Dataset Alphas must utilize data fields from only one dataset, with exceptions for the following 5 permitted grouping fields – country, exchange, market, sector, industry and subindustry.</li><li>The use of inst_pnl() and convert() operators is considered as utilizing the pv1 dataset since these operators rely on pv1 data for calculations.</li></ol><p><b>Submission Tests for Single Dataset Alphas</b></p><p>Single Dataset Alphas have slightly relaxed <a href=\"https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/consultant-information/consultant-submission-tests\">submission criteria</a> as compared to regular Alphas.
