These unwanted risk factors may not pose a problem in the back-testing period, but it could be harmful if they experience drawdowns in the out-sample stage.</p>",

As a rule of thumb, we recommend adopting the Slow Factors for low-turnover signals and Fast Factors or Slow + Fast factors for high-turnover signals. The Slow + Fast Factors incorporates both of the above factors together. However, there is no universal rule as to which alpha should apply certain risk factors. We recommend giving them a try and finding the most suitable risk factors for your needs.</p><p>When applying neutralization, please remember the turnover of the output alpha is likely to increase versus the input one, and more so when neutralizing to the Fast Factors. Fast Factors comprises high turnover factors that would change the position weights of your alpha more so than the Slow Factors (See table below) and thus increase alpha turnover. Thus using “Fast Factors” or “Slow + Fast Factors” neutralization would be beneficial in cases where the increase in turnover comes with a corresponding increase in Sharpe. You should balance the benefits from better risk-neutralization (higher Sharpe or lower drawdown) and increased turnover by sourcing the most relevant set of factors for each alpha and leveraging the knowledge of the alpha properties : for instance, if your alpha is not susceptible to some fast factors (i.e., reversion) by design, neutralizing to Fast factors might be redundant.</p><p>All of these risk factors’ settings will also assume long-short balanced with market neutralization for the risk-neutralized alphas. Besides the style factors, all risk factors’ settings include industries and market risk as well.</p><p></p><p></p>",
