The FAIL_THRESHOLD is the same as the usual overall Sharpe test you’re familiar with, which is 1.58 for Delay 1. The PASS_THRESHOLD is stricter and can differ for each year of iteration. For example, the PASS_THRESHOLD is 2.38 for years 2 to 5, 2.22 for year 6, 2.06 for year 7, etc.</p><p></p><p>In the first iteration, if the Alpha’s Sharpe for the most recent 2 years is below the FAIL_THRESHOLD of 1.58, the Alpha will fail the IS Ladder Sharpe test immediately. If it is above the relevant PASS_THRESHOLD of 2.38, the Alpha will pass the IS Ladder Sharpe test immediately. Otherwise, if it is above the FAIL_THRESHOLD but lower than the PASS_THRESHOLD, we will enter the next iteration where the Alpha’s Sharpe for the most recent 3 years will be compared to the two benchmarks.</p><p></p><p><b><i>Tip:</i></b> Some Alphas may have performed well in the past but deteriorated in recent years. Before you choose to double down on a particular Alpha idea, you may wish to check the Alpha’s performance in recent years. For example, is there a downward trend in its more recent PnL? Is the Alpha already failing the IS Ladder Sharpe test in the first iteration, which looks at the most recent two years?</p>",

      "value": "<p>The first and foremost step of building an alpha is coming up with an alpha idea. While there are multiple sources for finding ideas, research papers stand out as one of the most useful. In the beginning, the learn section of the platform is a good resource for sourcing ideas. For instance, the “Example” tab and Alpha concepts page are very useful. Although, for building low correlation alphas, it is important to use some unique or lesser utilized ideas. Research papers can assist you in finding different ideas.</p><p>Here are some general guidelines to build alphas using research papers:</p><p><b>Know your Operators</b>: The second step of the research process is to implement your alpha idea using operator. Hence, it is important to understand the concept of operators well. We recommend you go through the detailed operator descriptions before reading the research papers.</p><p><b>Reading the paper</b>: Visit any online journal and go through a few abstracts of the research papers. Choose a paper with an interesting idea to work with amongst all of the options. You can read the introduction, abstract, and main body. The aim is to gain a decent understanding of the research paper so that you know the methodology and data used by the authors.</p><p><b>Formulating your alpha</b>: The final step is to formulate your alpha. This is where your understanding of the operators comes in. Try to replicate the idea suggested in the paper and assess its performance, then think of any improvements that can be made on this version using any additional operators / data.</p><p>We will take you through an example <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=247435\">research paper</a> to show you how you can come up with an idea and refine it to create an alpha. This research paper talks about meeting or beating earnings estimate. Stocks that are better or equal to their earnings estimate are likely to show an outperformance as compared to other firms.</p><p><b>Iteration 1</b></p><p>Since the research paper is talking about an event (earnings release), we can use trade_when operator. A simple implementation of this idea could be to enter your positions when earnings estimate are beaten and amongst those stocks take positions according to the rank of ratio of actual earnings and estimated earnings and maintainyour position for the remainder of the quarter.</p><p>We have used the days_from_last_change operator to check if the earnings announcement was recent or not. The alpha below is in the US region, decay 4 and on subindustry neutralization, you can feel free to play around with the settings.</p><p></p>",

So, reading new ideas/papers will not only help you build high-sharpe alphas but also in bringing down your correlation, which should be an equally important goal of your research. Further, the target is never to make an alpha “just good enough to be submittable” you may carry forward improvements even after passing all tests and submit the best version that you deem fit since the OS results hold the highest importance.</p><p><b>Some Additional Tips</b></p><p>Reading helps. Almost none of the ideas given in the research papers would work as they are presented (in some cases, opposite works). They are helpful in guiding you to think in a certain direction which you might otherwise miss completely.</p><p>Before reading, also make sure that the dataset given in the research paper exists in Brain. This will save you a lot of time in case you read a research paper only to realize the dataset isn’t available.</p>",
