This is a new neutralization setting that we have added for Global region.

Read this page on <a href=\"https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/advanced-topics/getting-started-risk-neutralized-alphas\">risk neutralization</a> for more details. If you select one of SLOW/FAST/SLOW_AND_FAST as the neutralization setting, the group neutralization setting defaults to market. Hence, it is a good practice to check your risk-neutralized GLB alpha's performance with the group_neutralize operator and country grouping</li></ul><p></p><p><b>Sub-Geography Sharpe Cutoff for GLB Alphas</b></p>",
