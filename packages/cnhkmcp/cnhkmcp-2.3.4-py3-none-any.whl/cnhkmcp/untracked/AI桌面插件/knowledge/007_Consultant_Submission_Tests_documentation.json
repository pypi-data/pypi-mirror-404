An Alpha passes the Robust Universe Test if its performance on the adjusted universe retains <b>at least 90%</b> of the returns and Sharpe ratio compared to the original submission version.</p><p><b>Actionable tips to potentially pass Robust Universe Test for ASI Alphas</b><br/> Build Alphas that perform well across a wide, diverse universe, rather than relying on signals from a limited group of stocks. Also, prioritize signals with strong, intuitive economic rationale and broad applicability, rather than those tailored to specific stocks or historical quirks. Before submitting, test your Alpha on various universe configurations to ensure robust performance retention. You can also use visualization function to see how your Alpha performs in different countries/regions; try to submit Alphas that can have performance in various countries/regions rather than just a few countries/regions.</p><p></p>",
