There are no right or wrong answers in the alpha-making process since quant research is a mixture of creative and scientific thinking.</p><p>Typically, the alpha research cycle is comprised of 3 stages:</p><ol><li>Coming up with an intuitive alpha idea;</li><li>Implementing it using the available datasets and operators; and</li><li>Optimizing the parameters and neutralization settings of the alpha in order to submit it in its best form.</li></ol><p>While the alpha idea, datasets and operators keep changing, the techniques and methodologies needed to achieve the three remain largely the same. Hence, the following posts are a generic guide for your alpha research journey and will act as solid foundations for you:</p><p><a href=\"https://support.worldquantbrain.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/8123350778391-How-do-you-get-a-higher-Sharpe-\">How to get a higher Sharpe</a></p><p><a href=\"https://support.worldquantbrain.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/8833033953559--BRAIN-TIPS-5-ways-to-potentially-increase-returns-of-an-alpha\">How to potentially increase returns of an alpha</a></p><p><a href=\"https://support.worldquantbrain.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/8046468280727--BRAIN-TIPS-How-do-you-reduce-correlation-of-a-good-alpha-\">How to reduce correlation of an alpha</a></p><p><a href=\"https://support.worldquantbrain.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/8360363631127--BRAIN-TIPS-Using-trade-when-for-Event-Alphas-and-Low-Turnover-Alphas\">How to reduce turnover</a></p><p><a href=\"https://support.worldquantbrain.com/hc/en-us/articles/5969575839127-How-to-smooth-the-PnL-curve-to-minimize-sudden-fluctuations-\">How to potentially decrease PnL fluctuations</a></p><p><a href=\"https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/advanced-topics/neut-cons\">How to gain intuition for Neutralization</a></p><p><a href=\"https://support.worldquantbrain.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/8209806533015-How-can-you-avoid-overfitting-\">How to avoid overfitting</a></p><p>These readings answer some of the most common problems faced during the process of making alphas.
