If an ASI alpha is weak in Japan and derives most of its PnL outside JPN, it becomes difficult to realize due to lower liquidity, higher slippage, and limited capacity in other markets. Ensuring each ASI alpha achieves a minimum 1 Sharpe performance in Japan increases the realizability and scalability of PnL across ASI.</p><p><b>Note on Japan Sharpe shown in Visualization Tool versus this Test</b></p><ul><li>The Japan Robustness Sharpe Test and the Visualization Tool use different Japan universes. Consequently, the test result may differ from the Japan Sharpe displayed in the Visualization Tool.</li><li>The Visualization Tool remains highly useful for diagnosing Japan-specific PnL, turnover dynamics, sector/industry and capitalization breakdowns, and coverage trends, which can guide improvements to Japan robustness.</li></ul>",

For example, you can improve your Alpha in JPN Region and re-simulate it to finally submit it in ASI region if alpha initially has &lt;1 sharpe in JPN. Nonetheless, pass the Japan test with margin signals an economically grounded mechanism rather than country-specific overfitting.</li><li>Liquidity-aware construction: Emphasize large- and mid-cap breadth; avoid over-reliance on micro-caps where slippage/impact erode realized performance. Keep single-instrument weights well below 10%.</li><li>Avoid excessive size-only tilts: Unbounded cap or illiquidity multipliers can degrade robustness. If using cap/volume scalers, keep them bounded and balanced to prevent over-concentration.</li><li>Control sector/industry exposures: Use neutralization sensibly to avoid dominance by one industry. Inspect industry/sector-level PnL and Sharpe in the Visualization Tool to detect imbalances.</li><li>Stabilize turnover: Choose decay and smoothing that reduce churn without killing responsiveness. Very high turnover increases fragility under realistic costs; very low turnover may reduce adaptability.</li><li>Stress-test via Visualization Tool: Review Japan breakdowns for Coverage, Size, PnL, and Sharpe by Capitalization/Industry/Sector; analyze rolling performance, and seasonality. Even with universe differences, these diagnostics remain informative for improving Japan performance.</li></ul>",
