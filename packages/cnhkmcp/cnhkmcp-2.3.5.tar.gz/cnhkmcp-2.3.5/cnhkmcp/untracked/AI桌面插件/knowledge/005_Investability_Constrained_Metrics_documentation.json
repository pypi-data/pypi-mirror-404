Alphas that have good Investability Constraints Sharpe are likely to have good After-cost Sharpe also which will help improve your Combine Alpha Performance in Genius.</li><li><b>Optimization Metrics</b>: Consultants can leverage Investability Constrained Metrics as a metric to enhance your Alpha optimization process. Here’re some tips to create Alphas which such performance:<ul><li>An Alpha which captures signal in the liquid instruments space of the market may have higher Investability Constrained Performance. This is especially true for cases of medium to high turnover like Alphas in Price Volume, News, Options, etc. category. You should either control the liquidity profile of your signals or lower the turnover of the illiquid part of them. Please checkout some forum post about these technique in the References.</li><li>An Alpha with low turnover in general may be less impacted by these constraint for example Alphas in category Fundamental, Model, … Because it changes position in low frequency, thus its performance relies less on the liquidity of the instruments. Please checkout some forum post about creating low turnover Alphas in the References.</li></ul></li><li><b>Alpha Submissions Selection</b>: Use these metrics as a filter for selecting Alphas, especially in regions like ASI and GLB. Alphas that perform well under these constraints can possibily add significant value and may result in higher value factor and weight factor because they scale better when the booksize increases.</li><li><b>Apply Max Trade Settings to your Alpha</b>: In order to convert your Alphas into Investability Constrained Alphas, you can change the Max Trade option in Simulation Settings to ON. Please read <a href=\"https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/consultant-information/consultant-features\">this documentation</a> for further information.</li></ul>",
