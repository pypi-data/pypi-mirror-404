For a daily Alpha on BRAIN (the D1 and D0 Alpha), the PnL typically mainly comes from the holding PnL. The purpose of D0 Alphas is to try to capture more holding PnL with a longer holding period. Besides, there is a phenomenon in the financial market called \"Overnight Returns\" where the stock price changes in the after-hours session due to companies often releasing news/reports after market close, which is not captured by D1 Alphas.</p><p>Moreover, the D0 Alphas enter simulated trades before their D1 Alpha counterparts, so they're expected to have higher performance.</p>",

Please check the <a href=\"https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/data-and-operators/detailed-operator-descriptions\">dataset</a> page or <a href=\"https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data?delay=0&amp;instrumentType=EQUITY&amp;region=USA&amp;universe=TOP3000\">data explorer</a> to get such data. Currently, D0 Alphas are only available for the USA, EUR, and CHN regions.</p><p><b>Tips and Tricks for Researching D0 Alphas</b></p><p>Alphas that try to capture some financial event premium can work well in D0, like M&amp;A events, earnings announcements, stock repurchases, etc. Try to utilize the trade_when operator to capture these Alphas.</p><p>For the regions with price limits like CHN, if a stock reaches the price limit, the Alpha shouldn't change the position for that particular stock.</p><p>Since the submission criteria for D0 Alphas are high, it's not easy to start researching D0 Alpha ideas at first. One way to approach this problem is to re-simulate all your D1 Alphas in D0 settings, try to reimplement the ideas in D0, or try to change the used data fields to equivalent data fields in D0.</p><p>Because the D0 Alphas enter trades near the end of the regular trading hours, to ensure that the Alphas' positions can be filled, you should build Alphas on stocks with a higher liquidity profile (i.e., using a liquid universe like TOP1000 or higher for the USA region).</p><p><b>Alpha Robustness</b></p><p>Due to D0 Alphas normally having higher turnover than D1 Alphas, to compensate for the increasing transaction costs, higher Sharpe and higher returns are required. But there are also other tests that you have to consider, such as the SubUniverse test and the RobustUniverse test for the CHN region. Good performance in the liquid universe means that the Alpha should have higher capacity.</p><p>Also, be sure to self-check your Alpha's performance on D1 (if the data field is also available in D1). A good D0 Alpha should also retain some performance in D1, but there may be a decrease in performance.</p>",
