In each case, please refer to your individual consulting or service agreement with WorldQuant for details on such compensation.</p><p>In addition, you may be eligible to receive a referral fee from time to time based on successful referrals under the <a href=\"https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/referral\">referral program</a>.. You may also be considered for full-time positions and internship opportunities at WorldQuant and potentially invited to Brain’s exclusive knowledge sharing and networking meetups from time to time.</p><p><b>New Submission Tests</b></p><p>As a Research Consultant, your alphas will go through a stricter set of tests in order to clear the <a href=\"https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/consultant-information/consultant-submission-tests\">submission criteria</a>. For instance, each of your alpha’s correlation will be tested against all alphas in the consultant pool and not just your own.</p><p><b>Additional simulation results</b></p><p>As mentioned in the previous paragraph, one of the new features will provide you access to a <a href=\"https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/consultant-information/visualization-tool\">visualization tool</a> as part of your simulation results. You can check the simulated (i) coverage, (ii) PnL, (iii) Size and (iv) Sharpe of your alphas across various sectors and industries. This will help you identify whether or not your alpha has a concentration bias for any particular industry or sector and may provide insights on any potential improvements to your alpha.</p><p><b>More datasets and regions</b></p><p>You will also have access to the European, Chinese and Asian markets / universes after becoming a research consultant. In addition to these regions, you will also have access to <a href=\"https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets\">consultant only datasets</a>. New datasets help you in implementing various new alpha ideas as well as changing the implementation of your existing alpha ideas. A good way to start with new datasets could be implementing your existing alpha ideas with these datasets so that you can build an intuition for the same. All datasets have their descriptions listed alongside their type (vector/matrix) and their coverage across different regions. Combining base data fields is a good idea but remember to avoid overfitting by sticking to your original alpha idea.</p>",
