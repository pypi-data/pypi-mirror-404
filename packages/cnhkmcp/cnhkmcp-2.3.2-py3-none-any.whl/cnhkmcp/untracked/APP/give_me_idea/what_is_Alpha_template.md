What an alpha template is
An alpha template is a reusable recipe that captures an economic idea and leaves “slots” (data fields, operators, groups, decay, neutralization choices, etc.) to instantiate many candidate alphas. Typical structure: clean data (backfill, winsorize) → transform/compare across time or peers → rank/neutralize → (optionally) decay/turnover tune. Templates encourage systematic search, reuse, and diversification while keeping an explicit economic rationale.

Some Example Templates and rationales

CAPM residual (market/sector-neutral return): ts_regression(returns, group_mean(returns, log(ts_mean(cap,21)), sector), 252, rettype=0) after backfill+winsorize. Rationale: strip market/sector beta to isolate idiosyncratic alpha; sector-weighted by smoothed log-cap to reduce large-cap dominance.
CAPM beta (slope) template: same regression with rettype=2; pre-clean target/market (ts_backfill(...,63) + winsorize(std=4)). Rationale: rank stocks by relative risk within sector; long low-β, short high-β, or study β dispersion across groups.
CAPM generalized to any feature: data = winsorize(ts_backfill(<data>,63),std=4); data_gpm = group_mean(data, log(ts_mean(cap,21)), sector); resid = ts_regression(data, data_gpm, 252, rettype=0). Rationale: pull out the component unexplained by group average of same feature; reduces common-mode exposure.
Actual vs estimate spread (analyst): group_zscore( group_zscore(<act>, industry) – group_zscore(<est>, industry), industry ) or the abstracted group_compare(diff(group_compare(act,...), group_compare(est,...)), ...). Rationale: surprise/beat-miss signal within industry, normalized to peers to avoid level bias.
Analyst term-structure (fp1 vs fy1/fp2/fy2): group_zscore( group_zscore(anl14_mean_eps_<period1>, industry) – group_zscore(anl14_mean_eps_<period2>, industry), industry ) with operator/group slots. Rationale: cross-period expectation steepness; rising near-term vs long-term forecasts can flag momentum/inflection.
Option Greeks net spread: group_operator(<put_greek> - <call_greek>, <grouping_data>) over industry/sector (Delta/Gamma/Vega/Theta). Rationale: options-implied sentiment/convexity skew vs peers; outlier net Greeks may precede spot moves; extend with multi-Greek composites or time-series deltas.

## Operator Mastery (5 Categories)

### 1. Preprocessing & Data Cleaning
**Purpose**: Handle outliers, missing values, and scale normalization before transformation

**Core Operators**:
- `winsorize(x, std=4)`: Clip extreme values to reduce outlier impact (e.g., `winsorize(close/open, std=3)`)
- `fillna(x, value)`: Replace NaN with constant or method (e.g., `fillna(revenue, 0)`)
- `replace(x, old, new)`: Conditional replacement (e.g., `replace(div_yield, 0, nan)` to remove zero dividends)
- `normalize(x)`: Scale to [0,1] range
- `group_zscore(x, group)`: Standardize to mean=0, std=1 within group for cross-sectional comparison

**Best Practice**: Always winsorize raw data → handle NaN → normalize/zscore before ranking

---

### 2. Cross-Sectional Operations
**Purpose**: Rank stocks relative to peers at each timestamp

**Core Operators**:
- `rank(x)`: Percentile rank within universe (primary tool for signal construction)
- `group_rank(x, group)`: Rank within industry/sector/country (e.g., `group_rank(earnings_yield, industry)`)
- `group_neutralize(x, group)`: Remove group average (e.g., `group_neutralize(momentum, sector)` for sector-neutral momentum)
- `regression_neut(y, x)`: Remove linear exposure to factor (e.g., `regression_neut(returns, mkt_beta)` for market-neutral alpha)

**Template Pattern**:
```
group_rank(group_neutralize(group_zscore(winsorize([DATA_FIELD], std=3), [GROUP]), [GROUP]), [GROUP])
```

---

### 3. Time-Series Operations
**Purpose**: Capture trends, reversals, and smoothing across time

**Core Operators**:
- `ts_delta(x, n)`: n-period change (e.g., `ts_delta(close, 21)` for monthly momentum)
- `ts_sum(x, n)`: Rolling sum (e.g., `ts_sum(volume, 20)` for cumulative volume)
- `ts_mean(x, n)`: Simple moving average (e.g., `ts_mean(close, 50)` for trend)
- `ts_std(x, n)`: Rolling volatility (e.g., `ts_std(returns, 21)` for risk)
- `ts_rank(x, n)`: Percentile within lookback window (e.g., `ts_rank(close, 252)` for 52-week high proximity)
- `ts_decay_linear(x, n)`: Linear weighted average (recent data weighted higher)
- `ts_regression(y, x, n)`: Rolling beta/slope (e.g., `ts_regression(stock_ret, mkt_ret, 60)` for beta)

**Template Pattern for Momentum**:
```
ts_delta([PRICE_FIELD], [WINDOW]) / ts_std([PRICE_FIELD], [WINDOW])
```

---

### 4. Conditional & Logic Operations
**Purpose**: Implement if-then rules and filters

**Core Operators**:
- `if_else(cond, x, y)`: Ternary operator (e.g., `if_else(volume > ts_mean(volume, 20), group_rank(returns, sector), 0)`)
- `filter(x, cond)`: Set to NaN where condition fails (e.g., `filter(momentum, market_cap > 1e9)`)
- Comparison: `>`, `<`, `==`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=`
- Logical: `&` (and), `|` (or), `~` (not)

**Template Pattern for Conditional Alpha**:
```
if_else([CONDITION], group_rank([SIGNAL_A], [GROUP]), group_rank([SIGNAL_B], [GROUP]))
```

---

### 5. Vector & Advanced Operations
**Purpose**: Complex transformations and multi-factor combinations

**Core Operators**:
- `power(x, p)`: Exponentiation (e.g., `power(momentum, 2)` for convexity)
- `log(x)`: Natural log for skewed distributions (e.g., `log(market_cap)`)
- `abs(x)`: Absolute value (e.g., `abs(analyst_revision)` for surprise magnitude)
- `signed_power(x, p)`: Preserve sign with power (e.g., `signed_power(returns, 0.5)` for dampened momentum)
- `correlation(x, y, n)`: Rolling correlation (e.g., `correlation(stock_ret, spy_ret, 60)` for market sensitivity)

## Template Construction Methodology
**Purpose**: Automatically transform BRAIN dataset fields into deep, meaningful feature engineering ideas.
### Step 1: Define Economic Hypothesis
**quick example**
- **Value**: "Cheap stocks outperform" → Use `earnings_yield`, `book_to_price`
- **Momentum**: "Winners keep winning" → Use `ts_delta(close, 21)`, `ts_rank(close, 252)`
- **Quality**: "Profitable companies outperform" → Use `roe`, `gross_margin`
- **Volatility**: "Low-vol stocks outperform" → Use `-ts_std(returns, 21)` (negative for inverse ranking)
- **Liquidity**: "Liquid stocks have better execution" → Use `turnover`, `dollar_volume`


### Step 2: Generate ideas and Select Data Fields
- For each field, extract: id, description, dataType, update frequency, coverage
- **Deconstruct each field's meaning**:
  * What is being measured? (the entity/concept)
  * How is it measured? (collection/calculation method)
  * Time dimension? (instantaneous, cumulative, rate of change)
  * Business context? (why does this field exist?)
  * Generation logic? (reliability considerations)
- **Build field profiles**: Structured understanding of each field's essence

**performs deep analysis based on collected information:**

**A. Field Relationship Mapping**
- Analyze logical connections between fields
- Identify: independent fields, related fields, complementary fields
- Map the "story" the dataset tells
- **Key question**: What relationships are implied by these fields?

**B. Question-Driven Feature Generation (Internal Process)**
The skill asks itself these questions and generates feature concepts:

1. **"What is stable?"** → Look for invariants
   - Which fields or combinations remain relatively constant?
   - What stability measures make sense?

2. **"What is changing?"** → Analyze change patterns
   - Rate of change, acceleration, volatility
   - Trend vs. noise separation

3. **"What is anomalous?"** → Identify deviations
   - Outliers, unusual patterns, breaks from normal
   - Deviation magnitude and significance

4. **"What is combined?"** → Examine interactions
   - How fields interact, amplify, or offset each other
   - Synthesis creates new meaning

5. **"What is structural?"** → Study compositions
   - Constituent parts, proportional relationships
   - Structural changes over time

6. **"What is cumulative?"** → Explore accumulation effects
   - Building up over time, decay effects
   - Memory and persistence in data

7. **"What is relative?"** → Make comparisons
   - Relative positioning, ranking, normalization
   - Context within dataset

8. **"What is essential?"** → Distill to core meaning
   - First principles thinking
   - Strip away assumptions, get to essence

**C. Feature Concept Generation**
For each relevant question-field combination:
- Formulate feature concept that answers the question
- Define the concept clearly
- Identify the logical meaning
- Consider directionality (what high/low values mean)
- Identify boundary conditions
- Note potential issues/limitations

### Step 3: Apply Operator Pipeline to implement the idea
**Standard Pipeline**:
1. **Clean**: `winsorize([RAW_DATA], std=3)` → Remove outliers, note: be innovative to use related operators provided by users to handle outliers based on the data field characteristics
2. **Transform**: `group_zscore(...)` or `log(...)` → Normalize distribution, note: be innovative to use related operators provided by users to transform data based on the data field characteristics
3. **Rank**: `rank(...)` or `group_rank(..., [GROUP])` → Cross-sectional comparison, note: be innovative to use related operators provided by users to rank data based on the data field characteristics
4. **Neutralize** (optional): `group_neutralize(..., sector)` or `regression_neut(..., mkt_beta)` → Remove unwanted exposures, note: be innovative to use related operators provided by users to neutralize data based on the data field characteristics
5. **Decay** (optional): `ts_decay_linear(..., 5)` → Smooth signal turnover, note: be innovative to use related operators provided by users to decay data based on the data field characteristics

**Example Pipeline**:
```
ts_decay_linear(
    group_rank(
        group_neutralize(
            group_zscore(winsorize(earnings_yield, std=3), sector),
            sector
        )
    ,[grouping_field]),
    5
)
```

### Step 4: Define Parameter Slots for Search
Identify variables to optimize:
- **[WINDOW]**: Lookback period (e.g., 10, 20, 60, 120 days) `[WINDOW] ∈ {10, 20, 40, 60, 120}`
- **[DATA_FIELD]**: Alternative fields (e.g., `close`, `vwap`, `typical_price`)
- **[GROUP]**: Grouping variable (e.g., `sector`, `industry`, `country`) `[GROUP] ∈ {sector, industry, subindustry, country}`
- **[WINSORIZE_STD]**: Outlier threshold in standard deviations (e.g., 2, 3, 4) `[WINSORIZE_STD] ∈ [2, 4]`
- **[DECAY_WINDOW]**: Decay length (e.g., 3, 5, 10)

**Template with Slots**:
```
group_rank(ts_delta([DATA_FIELD], [WINDOW]) / ts_std([DATA_FIELD], [WINDOW]), [GROUP])
```

## Response Format Standards

When generating an alpha template, structure your response as follows:

### 1. Template Name
- Descriptive and concise (e.g., "Sector-Neutral Earnings Yield with Decay")

### 2. Economic Rationale
- 2-3 sentences explaining the hypothesis (e.g., "Companies with high earnings yield relative to sector peers tend to outperform due to value premium. Sector neutralization removes industry tilts. Decay reduces turnover.")

### 3. Base Expression
- Provide the core alpha formula with parameter slots clearly marked in `[BRACKETS]`

### 4. Parameter Slots & Search Space
- List each variable with allowed values:
  ```
  [VALUE_FIELD] ∈ {earnings_yield, book_to_price, fcf_yield}
  [GROUP] ∈ {sector, industry, country}
  [DECAY_WINDOW] ∈ {3, 5, 10}
  ```


### 5. Expected Characteristics
- Turnover estimate (e.g., "20-40% daily turnover without decay")
- Correlation risk (e.g., "May correlate with value factor; check against production alphas")

### 6. Variations & Extensions
- Suggest 2-3 alternative formulations:
  - Replace `earnings_yield` with `fcf_yield`
  - Add volatility weighting: `group_rank([SIGNAL] / ts_std(returns, 21), [GROUP])`
  - Test across regions (USA vs EUR vs ASI)

## Best Practices Checklist

Before finalizing a template, verify:

- [ ] **Data Validity**: All fields exist for chosen `region` and `delay`
- [ ] **Outlier Handling**: Winsorize or clip extreme values
- [ ] **NaN Handling**: Use `fillna` or `filter` to avoid NaN propagation
- [ ] **Turnover Management**: use properate operators to reduce or control trading costs, moreover, some operators can help you set turnover to a certain level.
- [ ] **Economic Sense**: Can you explain why this alpha should work in 2-3 sentences to a portfolio manager?

---

## Example Template Generation (Full Workflow)

**User Request**: "Create an alpha template for analyst estimate revisions with industry neutralization"

**Your Response**:

### Template Name
**Analyst EPS Revision Momentum - Industry Neutral**

### Economic Rationale
Stocks with positive analyst EPS revisions tend to outperform as analysts incorporate new information. Industry neutralization removes sector-wide trends (e.g., energy sector upgrades due to oil prices) to isolate stock-specific revisions. Short-term revisions (1-month) capture recent information flow.

### Base Expression
```
group_rank(group_neutralize(group_zscore([REVISION_FIELD], industry), industry), industry)
```

### Parameter Slots & Search Space
```
[REVISION_FIELD] ∈ {eps_revision_1m, eps_revision_3m, revenue_revision_1m}
industry: Fixed (industry-level grouping)
```

### Optimization Recommendation
- **Method**: Random search (3 field choices × minimal parameters = 3 simulations)
- **Selection Criteria**: Choose field with highest Sharpe ratio and turnover < 50%


### Expected Characteristics
- **Turnover**: 30-50% daily (revisions change frequently)
- **Correlation Risk**: May correlate with earnings momentum factor; verify against production

### Variations & Extensions
1. **Add Magnitude Weighting**: `group_rank(group_neutralize(group_zscore([REVISION_FIELD], industry) * abs(group_zscore([REVISION_FIELD], industry)), industry), industry)` → Give more weight to large revisions
2. **Combine with Surprise**: `group_rank(group_zscore([REVISION_FIELD], industry) + group_zscore(eps_surprise, industry), industry)` → Blend forward-looking and backward-looking signals
3. **Decay for Turnover**: `ts_decay_linear(group_rank(...), 5)` → Reduce trading costs

Do remember to make some innovation of the templates rather than just pick ones that already exist, making suitable adjustment based on the information provided and think really hard.
