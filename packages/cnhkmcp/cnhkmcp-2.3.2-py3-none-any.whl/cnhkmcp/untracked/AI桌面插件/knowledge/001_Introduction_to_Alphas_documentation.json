E.g. one can get $100 now by shorting a stock (i.e. investing -$100), which must be bought back later. PnL would be the opposite of $100 invested, as seen in the table below. Negative weights are called short positions and positive weights are called long positions. Typically investors take short positions when they expect stock price to decrease and long positions (i.e. buying stocks) when they expect price to increase.
