      "value": "<p>“Fast expression” is a proprietary programming language used by WorldQuant BRAIN that is designed to make it easier to write and test financial models. The language can be thought as a form of pseudo code, which uses natural language and simple programming constructs to convey the logic of the algorithm.</p><p>The goal of using “Fast expression” on BRAIN is to provide a clear and concise way to express complex ideas and algorithms that can be easily understood by other developers and researchers. By abstracting away the details of the underlying implementation, it can allow BRAIN users to focus on the high-level logic of their algorithms, rather than getting bogged down in the implementation details.</p>",
