It’s a unique universe consisting of illiquid equities, defined by our liquidity metrics: minimum volume of $1M.</p><p>The illiquid universe offers potential opportunities to capitalize on short term and long term price discrepancies due to its market inefficiency. However, it also implies higher trading costs, as short selling becomes more difficult and obtaining optimal order pricing is challenging due to slippage. For this reason, a new submission test for Alpha builds has been introduced in the ILLIQUID_MINVOL1M universe.</p>",
