In the PROPERTIES section at the bottom of the Simulation results. Using the template of Idea and Rationale. Otherwise the Alpha will not be eligible for Power Pool.</p><p>Here is an example description:</p><ul><li><b>Idea</b>: In normal market conditions, if a stock is shorted more, its likelihood of bouncing back may also increase (reversion). However, in extreme cases where the consensus in the market is high reflecting in extremely high/low level of short interest, it may potentially be better to follow that trend</li><li><b>Rationale for data used:</b> shrt3_bar field is a vector data field representing the demand to borrow stock, with higher values indicating higher demand</li><li><b>Rationale for operators used:</b></li><li>vec_avg(): Calculates the average value of shrt3_bar for a given day</li><li>Conditional operator: Separates normal cases from extreme ones</li><li>ts_backfill: Handles NaN values in the data field, detected by checking the coverage with a visualization tool</li></ul><p><b>How do I add or remove Alphas from the Power Pool?</b></p><p>You can view the list of your Power Pool Alphas on the Alphas Page under the <a href=\"https://platform.qa.worldquantbrain.com/alphas/submitted\">Submitted</a> tab. To remove a submitted Alpha from the Power Pool, go to the Submitted tab, open the Alpha description, and click the cross next to the \"PowerPoolSelected\" tag in the Properties section.</p><p><b>Please note that even after removing the tag, this Alpha will still be part of the self-correlation pool, so new Power Pool Alphas will still be checked for correlation against it.</b></p><p>To retag a submitted Alpha later to the Power Pool, in the Properties section of the Alpha, click on the Tags dropdown and retag the alpha as \"PowerPoolSelected\"</p><p></p><p><b>Tips to create Power Pool Alphas</b></p><ul><li>Review Merged Performance before tagging the Alpha</li><li>Explore Low turnover Alphas and liquid (small) universes, which can help improve <a href=\"https://support.worldquantbrain.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/29647491881623-How-to-Improve-After-Cost-Performance\">After Cost performance</a></li><li>Explore your existing Alpha pool for eligible signals</li><li>Make use of the newly released <a href=\"https://support.worldquantbrain.com/hc/en-us/articles/30816357468183-How-can-I-make-use-of-Investability-Constrained-PnL-for-excelling-in-Power-Pool-Alphas-Competition\">Investability Constrained PNL</a></li><li>Your pool should have diverse signals to ensure robust performance of your pool in OS.
