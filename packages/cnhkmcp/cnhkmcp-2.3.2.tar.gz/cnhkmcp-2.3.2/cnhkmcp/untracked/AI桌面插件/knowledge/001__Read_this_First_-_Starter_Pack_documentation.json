If the graph shows high fluctuations/volatility, despite the returns being high, the Alpha will not be deemed good enough.</p><p>WorldQuant aims to develop equity long-short market neutral Alphas that have low volatility and risk. Such investments are attractive because they are expected to produce substantially better risk-adjusted returns than long-only portfolios. Equity long-short market neutral strategy is used commonly by hedge funds, with the goal of minimizing exposure to the market and profit from the changes in the spread between two stocks.</p><p><i>Further Reading &amp; References:</i></p><p>[5] What to know about quantitative analysis.

Suppose you wanted to analyze a time series of daily closing stock prices for a given stock over a period of one year. You could obtain a list of all the closing prices for the stock from each day for the past year and analyze the time series data with technical analysis tools to know whether the stock’s time series shows any seasonality. This will help you to determine if the stock goes through peaks and troughs at regular times each year [<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timeseries.asp\">8</a>].</p><p>Alternatively, you can use cross-sectional analysis, where you compare a particular company to its industry peers. Cross-sectional analysis may focus on a single company for head-to-head analysis with its biggest competitors or it may approach it from an industry-wide lens to identify companies with a particular strength. Essentially, cross-sectional analysis shows an investor which company is best given the metrics you care about [<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cross_sectional_analysis.asp\">9</a>].</p><p>We hope you’ve enjoyed this guide!
