Basic Neutralization:</b></p><p>Neutralization is an operation in which the raw Alpha values are split into groups, and then normalized (the mean is subtracted from each value) within each group. The group can be the entire market, or the groups could be made using other classifications like industry or sub-industry.</p><p>This is done to focus on the relative returns of stocks within the group, and minimize risk exposure to the returns of the group. As a consequence of neutralization, the portfolio is half long, half short, and may guard the portfolio from market or industry shocks.</p><p></p>",

      "value": "<p>For example, while trading, we don't want to bet in the direction of market, in order to minimize \"market risk\". This is done by taking equal long and short positions, i.e. amount invested in long positions is roughly equal to that in short positions. This is called \"market neutralization\". In order to do this in BRAIN platform, we set Neutralization = market (or industry or sub-industry, as desired) in the simulation settings.</p><p>In addition to market neutralization, Sector, industry, and subindustry neutralization are present on BRAIN. Examining the hierarchy on the BRAIN, a sector is a super set of an industry, which in turn is a super set of a subindustry. For example, industrials is a sector that includes the machinery industry, within which the agricultural and farm machinery subindustry resides.</p><p>Suppose we have Alpha = -ts_delta (close, 5), where Alpha is the vector of values. Setting neutralization = market, would make the mean of the Alpha vector equal to zero, i.e. the Alpha vector would undergo the change: Alpha = Alpha - mean(Alpha).</p><p>This new vector is then normalized and scaled to booksize. The portfolio thus formed would contain equal money invested in long and short positions, and can be used to calculate that day's PnL.</p><p>When you simulate an Alpha, the platform automatically performs some operations in Setting on your submission. \"Neutralization in Simulation Settings\" neutralizes your alpha as the last step in the operations. This ensures that your Alpha is long short neutral.</p><p>“Neutralization in Simulation Settings” and ‘group_neutralize(x, group)’ use the same operation.</p><p>When to use group_neutralize: You can use group_neutralize(x, group) when you want to apply neutralization in a more granular fashion on your Alpha with different values of group.</p><p>What settings to use with group_neutralize: If you use `group_neutralize(x, group)` as the last operator, you can set “None” in Neutralization, “0” in Decay and “0” in Truncation in Simulation Settings ( value 0 will disable decay and truncation operators) . You can insert a decay/truncation operator directly in your alpha expression before group_neutralize.</p><p>Are ‘group_neutralize(x, group)’ and “Neutralization in Simulation Settings” interchangeable?</p><p>Yes, for example:</p><p>Suppose we have Alpha = -rank(ebit/capex), where Alpha is the vector of values.</p><p>alpha1 = -zscore(ebit/capex) with industry in Neutralization “0” in Decay and “0” in Truncation in Simulation Settings</p><p>alpha1 = group_neutralize(-zscore(ebit/capex),industry) “None” in Neutralization, “0” in Decay and “0” in Truncation</p><p>Tips:</p><ul><li>Always pick a value for neutralization; only leave it as None if neutralization is manually incorporated in the Alpha.</li><li>Try larger stock groups for more liquid universes that have less number of stocks since we want to have the decent number of stocks in each group</li><li>Try smaller stock groups for illiquid universes</li><li>Use ‘country’ and ‘exchange’ neutralization options for EUR, ASI regions</li></ul><p></p><p><b>Below are some of the recommended neutralization based on the dataset category. We highly recommend you to try these in your research</b></p>",
