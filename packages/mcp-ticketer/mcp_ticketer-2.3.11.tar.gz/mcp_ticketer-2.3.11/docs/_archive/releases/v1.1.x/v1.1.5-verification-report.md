### 2. GitHub Release Verification ✅

#### Git Tag Verification
```bash
git ls-remote --tags origin v1.1.5
```

**Release Notes Summary**:
- **Published by**: bobmatnyc
- **Published at**: November 22, 2025 at 20:28 UTC
- **Status**: ✅ Public and accessible

**Release Highlights**:
- Enhanced Linear view URL error detection
- Improved error messaging with actionable guidance
- Directs users to appropriate alternatives (`ticket_list`, `ticket_search`)
- Provides contextual explanations instead of confusing "Ticket not found" errors

---

### 3. Functional Verification ✅

#### Test Suite Execution
```bash
pytest tests/adapters/test_linear_view_error.py -v
```

**Results**: ✅ All 4 tests passed
```
test_view_url_helpful_error_when_api_fails ............ PASSED
test_view_url_helpful_error_when_api_succeeds ......... PASSED
test_non_view_id_does_not_trigger_view_error .......... PASSED
test_view_id_pattern_detection ........................ PASSED
```

**Test Coverage**:
- View URL pattern detection (slug-uuid format)
- Error messaging when API query fails
- Error messaging when API query succeeds
- Proper handling of non-view IDs (issue IDs, project IDs)

#### Fixed Functionality Verified
The release successfully addresses the Linear view URL issue:

**Before (v1.1.4)**:
- Generic "Ticket not found" error
- No guidance on what went wrong
- Users confused about why view URLs don't work

**After (v1.1.5)**:
```python
# Example error message for view URL: "mcp-skills-issues-0d0359fabcf9"

ValueError: Linear view URLs are not supported in ticket_read.

You provided a Linear View identifier (mcp-skills-issues-0d0359fabcf9).

View: My Custom View (2+ issues)

Linear Views represent collections of issues, not individual tickets.

To query multiple issues, please use:
  - ticket_list with filters (state, priority, assignee)
  - ticket_search to find specific issues
```

**Improvements**:
1. ✅ Clear explanation that view URLs aren't supported
2. ✅ Shows actual view name (when API succeeds)
3. ✅ Indicates issue count in the view
4. ✅ Suggests appropriate alternatives
5. ✅ Graceful fallback when API fails (uses "Linear View" generic name)

### 4. Distribution Files Verification ✅

**Local Build Files**:
```
dist/
├── mcp_ticketer-1.1.5-py3-none-any.whl (360K)
└── mcp_ticketer-1.1.5.tar.gz (1.4M)
```

- mcp_ticketer-1.1.5-py3-none-any.whl (368668 bytes)
- mcp_ticketer-1.1.5.tar.gz (1488013 bytes)
```

**Result**: ✅ Files uploaded successfully to PyPI

## Known Issues

### PyPI CDN Propagation Delay
**Issue**: Initial pip install failed with "Could not find version 1.1.5"
**Timeline**: ~2-3 minutes after upload
**Resolution**: CDN propagated successfully
**Workaround**: Use `pip install --no-cache-dir mcp-ticketer==1.1.5`

**Impact**: Minimal - standard PyPI behavior for new releases
