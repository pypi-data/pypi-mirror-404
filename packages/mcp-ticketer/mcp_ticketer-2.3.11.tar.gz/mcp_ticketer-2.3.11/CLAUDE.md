# Project Memory Configuration

This project uses KuzuMemory for intelligent context management.

## Project Information
- **Path**: /Users/masa/Projects/mcp-ticketer
- **Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Unknown

## Memory Integration

KuzuMemory is configured to enhance all AI interactions with project-specific context.

### Available Commands:
- `kuzu-memory enhance <prompt>` - Enhance prompts with project context
- `kuzu-memory learn <content>` - Store learning from conversations (async)
- `kuzu-memory recall <query>` - Query project memories
- `kuzu-memory stats` - View memory statistics

### MCP Tools Available:
When interacting with Claude Desktop, the following MCP tools are available:
- **kuzu_enhance**: Enhance prompts with project memories
- **kuzu_learn**: Store new learnings asynchronously
- **kuzu_recall**: Query specific memories
- **kuzu_stats**: Get memory system statistics

## Project Context

Universal ticket management interface for AI agents with MCP support

## Issue Tracking

**Primary Project**: https://linear.app/1m-hyperdev/project/mcp-ticketer-eac28953c267/issues

**IMPORTANT**: All issues and tickets for this project MUST be created in the Linear project above. This is the single source of truth for all project work items.
