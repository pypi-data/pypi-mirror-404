class MethodExpert:
    """ Create an object which will rate characteristic objects with any MCDA method.

        Parameters
        ----------
            method : MCDA_Method
                Any object of the MCDA method inherited from MCDA_Method.

            weights : ndarray
                Criteria weights. Sum of the weights should be 1. (e.g. sum(weights) == 1)

            types : ndarray
                Array with definitions of criteria types:
                1 if criteria is profit and -1 if criteria is cost for each criteria in `matrix`.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from pymcdm.methods import COMET, TOPSIS
        >>> from pymcdm.methods.comet_tools import MethodExpert

        >>> expert_function = MethodExpert(TOPSIS(), weights, types)
