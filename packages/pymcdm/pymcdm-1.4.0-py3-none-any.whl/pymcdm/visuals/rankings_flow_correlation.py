    """ Visualize changes in rankings for several different rankings. As well
        as show the correlation change for this rankings. Main purpose of this
        function is to visualize the data from `leave_one_out_rr` function,
        however it also could visualize manually prepared rankings.

        This function will divide ax into two different axes
        to draw both plots.

        Parameters
        ----------
            rankings : ndarray
                ndarray with rankings from different methods.
                Ranking from different methods should be in rows.
                Zeros treated as missing values (alternatives).

            correlations : Iterable
                Iterable with correlation values which should be displayed.

            labels : list of str or None
                Labels or name for rankings for xticklabels.
                If None, the rankings would be named R1, R2, etc.

            colors : Iterable or None
                Colors for lines. If list of the colors is shorter then number
                of rankings then colors will be cycled.

            correlation_name : str
                Str with correlation name which should be displayed as ylabel on
                correlation plot. Default is 'Correlation'.

            correlation_ax_size : str
                Valid argument for matplotlib AxisDivider, size of the correlation
                plot relatively to full height of the plot. Default is '25%'.

            correlation_plot_kwargs : dict
                Kwargs to be passed into `correlation_plot` function.

            ranking_flows_kwargs : dict
                Kwargs to be passed into `ranking_flows` function.

            ax : Axes or None
                Axes object to draw on. If None current Axes will be used.

        Returns
        -------
            ax : Axes
                Axes object on which ranking flows were drawn.

            cax : Axes
                Axes object on which correlation plot was drawn.
