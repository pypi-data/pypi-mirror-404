class RANCOM(PairwiseWeightsBase):
    """
    A subclass of PairwiseWeightsBase implementing the RANCOM (RANking COMparison) method [#rancom1]_.

    The RANCOM class computes weights for pairwise comparisons based on rankings or user-provided
    input.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ranking : np.ndarray | list | tuple, optional
        Array representing the ranking of objects. Only one of `ranking`, `scoring`,
        `object_names`, `matrix`, or `filename` must be provided.
    scoring : np.ndarray | list | tuple, optional
        Array representing the scoring of objects.
    object_names : list of str, optional
        List of names corresponding to the objects being compared. This triggers
        manual pairwise comparison.
    matrix : np.ndarray | list | tuple, optional
        Predefined pairwise comparison matrix.
    filename : str, optional
        Path to a CSV file containing a pairwise comparison matrix.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from pymcdm.weights.subjective import RANCOM
    >>> rancom = RANCOM(ranking=[1, 2, 4, 3]) # Identify weights for four criteria based on ranking
    >>> weights = rancom()
    [0.4375 0.3125 0.0625 0.1875]
    >>> rancom = RANCOM(object_names=['Price', 'Mileage', 'HP', 'Year']) # Identify weights based on manual comparisons
    >>> weights = rancom()
    [0.4375 0.3125 0.0625 0.1875]

        Maps a numerical answer value to its corresponding inverse value.

        In case of RANCOM the mapping is as follows:

        Parameters
        ----------
        ans : float
            The numerical value to map.

        Returns

        Compares two objects based on their ranking values.

        In the ranking, smaller values represent better options. The comparison returns:
        - `1` if the first object is ranked better than the second.
        - `0` if the second object is ranked better than the first.
        - `0.5` if the two objects are equally ranked.

        Parameters
        ----------
        i : int
            Index of the first object in the ranking.
        j : int
            Index of the second object in the ranking.

        Returns
        -------
