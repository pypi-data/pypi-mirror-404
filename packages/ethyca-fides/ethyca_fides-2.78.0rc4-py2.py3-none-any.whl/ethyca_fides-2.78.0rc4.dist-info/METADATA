![Fides banner](docs/fides/docs/img/fides-banner.png "Fides banner")

## :zap: Overview

Fides (pronounced */fee-dhez/*, from Latin: Fidēs) is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in your runtime environment, and the enforcement of privacy regulations in your code.

## :rocket: Quick Start

### Getting Started

In order to get started quickly with Fides, a sample project is bundled within the Fides CLI that will set up a server, privacy center, and a sample application for you to experiment with.

#### Minimum requirements (for all platforms)

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (version 20.10.11 or later)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.9 through 3.10)

#### Download and install Fides

> [!TIP]
> We highly recommend setting up a Python virtual environment such as `venv` to install Fides into. For example:
>
> ```sh
> mkdir ~/fides
> cd ~/fides
> python3 -m venv venv
> source venv/bin/activate
> ```

Once your virtual environment is ready, you can easily download and install Fides using `pip`. Run the following command to get started:

```
pip install ethyca-fides
```

#### Deploy the Fides sample project

By default, Fides ships with a small project belonging to a fictional e-commerce store. Running the `fides deploy up` command builds a Fides project with all you need to run your first Data Subject Request against real databases.

```sh
fides deploy up
```

#### Explore the sample project

When your deployment finishes, a welcome screen will explain the key components of Fides and the sample "Cookie House" project.

If your browser does not open automatically, you should navigate to <http://localhost:3000/landing>.

The project contains:

* The Fides Admin UI for managing privacy requests
* The Fides [Privacy Center](https://ethyca.com/docs/dev-docs/privacy-requests/privacy-center) for submitting requests
* The sample "Cookie House" eCommerce site for testing
* A DSR Directory on your computer to view results (`./fides_uploads`)

#### Run your first Privacy Access Request

Navigate to the Fides Privacy Center (<http://localhost:3001>), submit a "Download your data" request, provide the email address for the sample user (`jane@example.com`), and submit the request.

Then, navigate to the Fides Admin UI (<http://localhost:8080>) to review the pending privacy request.

Use username `root_user` and password `Testpassword1!` to login, approve the request, and review the resulting package in your `./fides_uploads` folder!

### Next Steps

Congratulations! You've just run an entire privacy request in under 5 minutes! Fides offers many more tools to help take control of your data privacy. To find out more, you can run a privacy request on [your own infrastructure](https://ethyca.com/docs/tutorials/privacy-requests), discover [data mapping](https://ethyca.com/docs/tutorials/data-mapping), or learn about the [Fides Taxonomy](https://ethyca.github.io/fideslang/).

## :book: Learn More

The Fides core team is committed to providing a variety of documentation to help get you started using Fides.  As such, all interactions are governed by the [Fides Code of Conduct](https://ethyca.com/docs/community/code_of_conduct).

## ⚠️ Advanced Setup for Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) Support

By default, running `pip install ethyca-fides` locally will not install the optional Python libraries needed for Microsoft SQL Server, since these rely on additional system dependencies (`freetds`)! However, if you *do* want to connect to MSSQL, you have two options:
1. Use our pre-built Docker images which install these optional dependencies automatically: [`ethyca/fides`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethyca/fides). See our [Deployment Guide](https://ethyca.com/docs/dev-docs/configuration/deployment) for more!
2. Install the required dependencies on your local development machine and run `pip install "ethyca-fides[all]"` to include "all" the optional libraries. Keep reading to learn more about this!

For local development setup on macOS, follow these steps:
1. Install the required development libraries from Homebrew:
```zsh
brew install freetds openssl
```
2. Add the following to your shell (i.e. `.zshrc`) to ensure your compiler can access the `freetds` and `openssl` libraries, updating the paths & versions to match your local install:
```zsh
export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/freetds/lib -L/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl/lib"
export CFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/freetds/include"
```
3. Reinstall Fides with MSSQL support by including the `all` extra requirement:
```zsh
pip install "ethyca-fides[all]"
```
