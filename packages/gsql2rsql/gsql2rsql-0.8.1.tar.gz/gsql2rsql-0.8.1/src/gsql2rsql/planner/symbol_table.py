"""Symbol table for tracking variable definitions and scopes.

This module provides a centralized mechanism for tracking Cypher variables,
their types, and their scopes throughout the transpilation process.

The SymbolTable supports:
- Nested scopes (WITH clauses create new scopes)
- Variable definitions (entities, values, paths)
- Scope-aware lookup
- Full context for error messages
