"""Test 21: Variable-Length Path with Zero-Length (*0..N).

Validates that variable-length paths with min_hops=0 correctly include
zero-length paths (identity paths) in the results.

Zero-length paths mean the starting node itself is included, representing
an "identity" relationship where no edges are traversed.
