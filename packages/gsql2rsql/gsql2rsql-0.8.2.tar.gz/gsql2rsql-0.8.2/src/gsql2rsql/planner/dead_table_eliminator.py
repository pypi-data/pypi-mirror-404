"""Dead Table Elimination Optimizer.

This module implements an optimization pass that removes unnecessary JOINs from
the logical plan when the joined table's columns are not used in the output.

Design Decision: Optimizer vs Planner
=====================================

We chose to implement this as an **Optimizer** (post-planning transformation)
rather than modifying the Planner for several reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: The Planner's job is to faithfully translate
   Cypher semantics to a logical plan. Determining which columns are "dead"
   requires global analysis of RETURN/WHERE/ORDER BY clauses, which the Planner
   doesn't have at match-pattern construction time.

2. **Debuggability**: With an Optimizer, we can log/compare plans before and
   after transformation. If the Planner didn't create JOINs at all, there's
   nothing to compare.

3. **Feature Flag**: Easy to disable (`enabled=False`) for debugging or when
   correctness > performance (e.g., orphan edge detection).

4. **Follows Existing Pattern**: The project already has `SubqueryFlatteningOptimizer`
   and `SelectionPushdownOptimizer` as post-planning transformations.

Trade-offs Considered
=====================

1. **Performance vs Correctness (Orphan Edges)**
   - Optimized: `MATCH ()-[r]->() RETURN r` → `SELECT * FROM edges`
   - Original: `SELECT * FROM edges JOIN nodes ON ... JOIN nodes ON ...`
   - Difference: Original filters out edges pointing to non-existent nodes
   - Decision: Assume referential integrity (most graphs have it), provide flag

2. **Semi-join vs Full Elimination**
   - For typed nodes: `MATCH (a:Person)-[r]->(b) RETURN r`
   - Full elimination: Can't use `:Person` filter
   - Semi-join: `WHERE src IN (SELECT node_id FROM nodes WHERE type='Person')`
   - Decision: Use semi-join for typed nodes, full elimination for untyped

3. **Optimizer Overhead**
   - We create JOINs in Planner only to remove them in Optimizer
   - Trade-off: Small overhead for creation vs cleaner architecture
   - Decision: Accept overhead (plan creation is fast, execution is slow)

4. **Column Reference Analysis**
   - Must traverse all expressions (RETURN, WHERE, ORDER BY, aggregations)
   - Risk: Missing some reference → incorrectly remove needed JOIN
   - Decision: Conservative analysis - if unsure, keep JOIN

5. **Spark Optimizer Interaction**
   - Spark Catalyst can push projections but can't eliminate semantic JOINs
   - Our optimization is complementary, not redundant
   - Decision: Do both - our optimization + trust Spark for the rest

Usage
=====

Direct usage::

    optimizer = DeadTableEliminationOptimizer(enabled=True)
    optimizer.optimize(plan)
    print(optimizer.stats)  # See what was eliminated

Via optimize_plan::

    # In subquery_optimizer.py:
    def optimize_plan(..., dead_table_elimination: bool = True):
        if dead_table_elimination:
            DeadTableEliminationOptimizer().optimize(plan)
        ...

Via GraphContext::

    # In graph_context.py:
    graph = GraphContext(..., optimize_dead_tables=True)
    sql = graph.transpile("MATCH ()-[r]->() RETURN r")

Caveats and Special Cases
=========================

1. **OPTIONAL MATCH**: LEFT JOINs must NOT be eliminated (would change semantics)
2. **Aggregations**: `COUNT(DISTINCT a)` requires `a` even if not in RETURN
3. **ORDER BY**: `RETURN r ORDER BY a.name` requires JOIN for `a`
4. **Variable Length Paths**: Special handling via RecursiveTraversalOperator
5. **Bidirectional**: `(a)-[r]-(b)` uses UNION ALL internally, JOINs still can be dead

class DeadTableEliminationOptimizer:
    """Optimizer that removes JOINs with tables not contributing to output.

    This optimizer analyzes which entity variables (nodes/relationships) are
    actually used in the query output (RETURN, WHERE, ORDER BY, aggregations)
    and eliminates JOINs that only exist for pattern matching but whose
    columns are never accessed.

    Example Optimization
    --------------------

    Query: `MATCH (a)-[r]->(b) RETURN r`

    Before optimization:
        - Scan nodes (for a)
        - JOIN edges ON a.node_id = r.src
        - Scan nodes (for b)
        - JOIN ON r.dst = b.node_id
        - Project r

    After optimization:
        - Scan edges
        - Project r

    The JOINs with nodes table were eliminated because neither `a` nor `b`
    appear in RETURN, WHERE, or ORDER BY.

    Architectural Decision
    ----------------------

    Why Optimizer and not Planner?

    The Planner builds the logical plan by translating MATCH patterns literally.
    `MATCH (a)-[r]->(b)` semantically means "find edges where both endpoints
    exist in the nodes table". The Planner correctly creates JOINs for this.

    The Optimizer has access to the FULL query context (RETURN, WHERE, ORDER BY)
    and can determine that certain JOINs, while semantically correct, are
    unnecessary for computing the result. This is a **transformation**, not
    a **semantic interpretation**.

    Following SoC (Separation of Concerns):
    - Parser: Syntax → AST
    - Planner: Semantics → Logical Plan
    - Optimizer: Transformation → Better Logical Plan (this class)
    - Renderer: Logical Plan → SQL String

    If we put this in the Planner, it would need to know about RETURN/WHERE
    at MATCH time, violating the single-responsibility principle.

    Thread Safety
    -------------

    This class is NOT thread-safe. Each optimization should use a new instance:
