//! # grafeo-core
//!
//! The core data structures behind Grafeo. You'll find graph storage, indexes,
//! and the execution engine here.
//!
//! Most users don't need this crate directly - use `grafeo` or `grafeo-engine`
//! instead. But if you're building algorithms or need low-level access, this
//! is where the action is.
//!
//! ## Modules
//!
//! - [`graph`] - Graph storage: LPG (labeled property graph) and RDF triple stores
//! - [`index`] - Fast lookups: hash, B-tree, adjacency lists, tries
//! - [`execution`] - Query execution: data chunks, vectors, operators
//! - [`statistics`] - Cardinality estimates for the query optimizer
//! - [`storage`] - Compression: dictionary encoding, bit-packing, delta encoding
