# Section Definitions

## Performance Optimization (perf)
**Impact:** CRITICAL

Apply Python optimization patterns to improve processing speed and memory efficiency.
Covers list comprehensions, generators, efficient data structure selection, and other techniques that leverage Python's characteristics.

**Rules:**
- `perf-list-comprehension` - Prefer list comprehensions over loops
- `perf-generator-expression` - Use generators for large datasets
- `perf-dict-get` - Use dict.get() for efficient default values
- `perf-set-lookup` - Use set for fast lookups instead of list
- `perf-str-join` - Use join for string concatenation

## Async Processing (async)
**Impact:** HIGH

Efficient asynchronous programming patterns using asyncio.
Covers concurrent execution of I/O-bound operations, resource management, and concurrency control.

**Rules:**
- `async-gather` - Use asyncio.gather for independent tasks
- `async-create-task` - Proper background task creation
- `async-context-manager` - Resource management with async with
- `async-semaphore` - Limit concurrency with semaphores

## Design Principles (design)
**Impact:** HIGH

Software design principles for maintainability and extensibility.
Covers single responsibility, dependency injection, pure functions, and other principles for building robust codebases.

**Rules:**
- `design-philosophy` - DRY, YAGNI, KISS principles
- `design-single-responsibility` - Single Responsibility Principle
- `design-dependency-injection` - Loose coupling with dependency injection
- `design-pure-functions` - Prefer pure functions without side effects
- `design-early-return` - Reduce nesting with early returns

## Object-Oriented Programming (oop)
**Impact:** MEDIUM

Best practices for Pythonic object-oriented programming.
Covers class design, composition vs inheritance, dataclasses, and protocols.

**Rules:**
- `oop-composition-over-inheritance` - Prefer composition over inheritance
- `oop-dataclass` - Use dataclass for data containers
- `oop-protocol` - Prefer Protocol over abstract base classes
- `oop-property` - Use property instead of getters
