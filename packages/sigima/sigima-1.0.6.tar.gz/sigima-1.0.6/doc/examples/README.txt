Examples
========

This section presents a collection of examples demonstrating the capabilities of Sigima.
Each example is a standalone Python script that showcases specific features or use cases
of the Sigima library, along with visualizations of the results (using an internal
plotting module `sigima.tests.vistools` based on `PlotPyStack <https://github.com/PlotPyStack>`_).

Of course, some of these examples may seem trivial, but they serve to illustrate how to use
various functionalities of Sigima in a clear and concise manner.

.. note::

    These examples are automatically generated when building the documentation, thus
    ensuring that they are always up-to-date with the latest version of Sigima.
