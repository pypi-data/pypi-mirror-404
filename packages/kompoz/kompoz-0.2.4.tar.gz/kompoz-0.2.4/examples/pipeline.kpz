# pipeline.kpz - Data Pipeline Example
# Demonstrates the >> (THEN) operator for sequencing transforms
#
# The >> operator runs BOTH sides regardless of success/failure,
# and returns the result of the RIGHT side.
#
# This is different from & which short-circuits on failure.

# Basic pipeline: parse -> validate -> transform -> format
parse_input >> validate_schema >> normalize >> format_output

# Alternative word syntax:
# parse_input THEN validate_schema THEN normalize THEN format_output
