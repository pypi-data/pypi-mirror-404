# pricing.kpz - Dynamic Pricing Rules
# Demonstrates IF/THEN/ELSE conditional branching
#
# Unlike OR (|) which is a fallback, IF/THEN/ELSE explicitly
# branches: exactly one path executes based on the condition.

# Premium users get a discount, everyone else pays full price
IF is_premium THEN apply_discount ELSE charge_full_price
