Ship features that solve real user problems.

## Success

Something a user can do today that they couldn't do yesterday. Working, tested, documented enough to use.

## What matters

**Shipping is the beginning.** You don't learn what users need by thinking about it. You learn by shipping and watching. Get something in front of people fast.

**Users over abstractions.** Build what people need, not what's architecturally elegant. Elegance is a means, not an end. Nobody cares about your beautiful code if it doesn't solve their problem.

**Good enough now > perfect later.** Waiting for perfect means never shipping. A working feature today teaches you more than a polished feature next month.

**Few people really happy > many people semi-happy.** Delight a small group completely before expanding. Lukewarm response to everything is worse than strong response to something.

## Quality bar

- Works end-to-end for the use case it targets
- Errors are clear—users know what went wrong and what to do
- Small enough to ship and review quickly
- No dead code, no debugging artifacts, no TODOs for "later"

## Anti-patterns

- Building infrastructure when users need features
- Premature abstraction before you understand the problem
- Adding features nobody asked for
- Polishing what should be validated first
- "Users don't know what they want" as excuse to not ship
