Make things simple and clear.

## Success

A design that explains itself. Code another engineer could implement confidently. An interface users understand without a tutorial.

## What matters

**Finish the thought.** Half-designed is worse than undesigned. A complete solution to a small problem beats an incomplete solution to a big one. Don't stop at "good enough"—stop at "done."

**Understand before solving.** The urge to ship is strong. Resist it until you understand the problem. Most bad designs come from solving the wrong problem quickly.

**Depth over breadth.** One thing designed well beats three things sketched loosely. Spreading effort thin produces nothing worth having.

**Constraints are friends.** The best work comes from embracing limitations, not fighting them. "What's the simplest thing that could work?" is the most powerful design question.

## Quality bar

- Someone unfamiliar could understand it in 5 minutes
- Trade-offs are explicit, not hidden in complexity
- Edge cases are handled, not ignored
- Works for all user types—humans, LLMs, keyboard users, screen readers

## Anti-patterns

- Designing for the general case before understanding the specific one
- Shipping to "learn" when you could think harder first
- Hiding complexity instead of eliminating it
- Assuming users will read documentation
- Calling something "MVP" when it's actually "unfinished"
