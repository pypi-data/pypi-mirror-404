Summarize this codebase for LLM context. Target: {token_budget} tokens.

Prioritize:
1. **Data structures** - Core types with field annotations
2. **Public APIs** - Function signatures with one-line descriptions
3. **Key patterns** - How the codebase is organized
4. **Direct quotes** - Preserve exact names, paths, commands

Format as dense markdown. No fluff. Code blocks for types/signatures.
Omit implementation details unless they're critical to understanding.
