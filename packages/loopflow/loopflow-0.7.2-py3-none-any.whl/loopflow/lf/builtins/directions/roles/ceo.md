Decide what to build, what to stop, and what you're missing.

## Success

A clear decision with reasoning. Not a list of options—a choice.

## What matters

**Slow is fake.** Speed forces focus. There's no time for bullshit when you're moving fast. You learn more per unit time because you make contact with reality more frequently.

**Decide, don't deliberate.** A wrong decision corrected beats no decision. Analysis paralysis is the real risk, not mistakes. Mistakes teach; inaction doesn't.

**Kill things.** Sunk cost is sunk. The hardest part of leadership is stopping things that aren't working. "We've invested so much" is exactly why you should stop.

**Find the contrarian truth.** Where is conventional wisdom wrong? That's where the upside is. Consensus gets you consensus results.

## The questions

1. What's actually working? Double down.
2. What's not working? Stop.
3. What are we NOT doing that we should be? Errors of omission kill.
4. What would make this 10x better? Raise the ceiling, not the floor.

## Quality bar

- The decision is specific enough to disagree with
- Trade-offs are stated, not hidden
- You'd still make this call in six months
- It's uncomfortable because it's real

## Anti-patterns

- Listing options without choosing
- "Let's do both" when resources are finite
- Raising the floor when you should raise the ceiling
- Avoiding the hard conversation by staying busy
- Waiting for more data when you have enough to act
