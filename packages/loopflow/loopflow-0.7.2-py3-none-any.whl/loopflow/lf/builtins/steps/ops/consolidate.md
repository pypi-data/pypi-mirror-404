Clean up scratch/—combine related content, remove stale material, make docs coherent.

## Context

Analysis steps accumulate files in scratch/—research, opportunities, priorities, synthesis. Over time this becomes cluttered with outdated content, redundant files, and fragmented ideas. Consolidate into a clean state.

## Workflow

1. Read everything in scratch/
2. Identify what's current vs outdated
3. Combine related content into unified files
4. Delete or archive superseded material
5. Make remaining docs standalone and coherent

## What to do

**Combine:**
- Multiple files covering the same topic → one file
- Fragmented notes → coherent document
- Related proposals → unified plan

**Remove:**
- Content superseded by later analysis
- Working notes that informed decisions (the decision matters, not the notes)
- Stale items that no longer apply

**Keep:**
- Active design docs for current work
- Research with lasting value
- Decisions that should be remembered

## Consolidation principles

**Standalone files.** Each file should make sense without reading the others. Don't assume readers saw earlier drafts.

**Current state.** Files should reflect current understanding, not history. If something changed, update it—don't keep both versions.

**Clear scope.** Each file should have obvious boundaries. Split sprawling docs into focused pieces, or combine fragments into one coherent doc.
