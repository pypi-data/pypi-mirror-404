Combine multiple perspectives into one coherent result.

## Context

Multiple agents worked on the same task with different directions. Their outputs are available as drafts. Your job is to synthesize them—find the signal, resolve conflicts, produce one unified output.

## Workflow

1. Read each draft. Understand what each perspective emphasized.
2. Find agreements—where drafts converge, the signal is strong.
3. Find tensions—where drafts diverge, there's a real tradeoff.
4. Synthesize into one coherent result in `scratch/synthesis.md`.

## What synthesis is

**Synthesis is not averaging.** Don't water down strong positions into mush. If one draft has a sharp insight, preserve it.

**Synthesis is not picking a winner.** The goal isn't to choose the best draft—it's to produce something better than any single draft by combining their strengths.

**Synthesis is finding the throughline.** What would someone who held all these perspectives at once conclude?

## Output

Write `scratch/synthesis.md`:

```markdown
# Synthesis

## Perspectives

<What each draft emphasized. 1-2 sentences each.>

## Agreements

<Where drafts converged. Strong signal.>

## Tensions

<Where drafts diverged. Real tradeoffs.>

## Synthesis

<The unified result. Incorporates agreements, resolves tensions.>
```

## Resolution principles

**Convergence = signal.** When multiple perspectives reach the same conclusion independently, weight it heavily.

**Divergence = tradeoff.** When perspectives conflict, name the tradeoff explicitly. Don't pretend there's no cost.

**Your direction matters.** If you have a direction (e.g., ceo), use it to break ties. The synthesis should reflect that lens.
