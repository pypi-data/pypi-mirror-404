## [0.19.2]
- Add boolean data type support plus `nullable`/`metadata` on schema types and generated JSON Schema.
- BREAKING: OpenAI proxy client creation now takes an optional `http_client` (request logging is configured via a separate logging client helper).

- Add `log_llm_requests` support to enable OpenAI request/response logging.

## [0.19.1]
- Add optional metadata to agent chat contexts and propagate it through message-stream LLM delegation, including recording thread participant lists
- Add an option for the mailbot CLI to delegate LLM interactions to a remote participant instead of using the local LLM adapter

## [0.19.0]

- Add optional voicebot transcription via a provided transcript path, wrapping the voice agent to persist user/assistant speech to a transcript document
- Refactor meeting transcription to use the shared transcript logger with per-participant sessions and improved session lifecycle cleanup
- Breaking change: starting a new email thread no longer accepts attachments; attachments are now handled by a dedicated “new thread with attachments” tool that downloads files from room storage before sending

## [0.18.1]
- Updated OpenAI Python SDK dependency to `openai~=2.14.0` (from `~2.6.0`).

- `TaskRunner.ask` now supports optional binary attachments; `LLMTaskRunner` can unpack tar attachments and pass images/files into the LLM conversation context
