              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# pyiceberg-firestore-gcs

A Firestore + Google Cloud Storage (GCS) backed implementation of a
lightweight catalog interface. This package provides an opinionated
catalog implementation for storing table metadata documents in Firestore and
consolidated Parquet manifests in GCS.

**Important:** This library is *modelled after* Apache Iceberg but is **not
compatible** with Iceberg; it is a separate implementation with different
storage conventions and metadata layout. This library is the catalog and
metastore used by [opteryx.app](https://opteryx.app/) and uses **Firestore** as the primary
metastore and **GCS** for data and manifest storage.

---

## Features ✅

- Firestore-backed catalog and collection storage
- GCS-based table metadata storage; export/import utilities available for artifact conversion
- Table creation, registration, listing, loading, renaming, and deletion
- Commit operations that write updated metadata to GCS and persist references in Firestore
- Simple, opinionated defaults (e.g., default GCS location derived from catalog properties)
- Lightweight schema handling (supports pyarrow schemas)

## Quick start 💡

1. Ensure you have GCP credentials available to the environment. Typical approaches:
   - Set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to a service account JSON key file, or
   - Use `gcloud auth application-default login` for local development.

2. Install locally (or publish to your package repo):

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

3. Create a `FirestoreCatalog` and use it in your application:

```python
from pyiceberg_firestore_gcs import create_catalog
from pyiceberg.schema import Schema, NestedField
from pyiceberg.types import IntegerType, StringType

catalog = create_catalog(
	"my_catalog",
	firestore_project="my-gcp-project",
	gcs_bucket="my-default-bucket",
)

# Create a collection
catalog.create_collection("example_collection")

# Create a simple PyIceberg schema
schema = Schema(
	NestedField(field_id=1, name="id", field_type=IntegerType(), required=True),
	NestedField(field_id=2, name="name", field_type=StringType(), required=False),
)

# Create a new dataset (metadata written to a GCS path derived from the bucket property)
table = catalog.create_dataset(("example_collection", "users"), schema)

# Or register a table if you already have a metadata JSON in GCS
catalog.register_table(("example_namespace", "events"), "gs://my-bucket/path/to/events/metadata/00000001.json")

# Load a table
tbl = catalog.load_dataset(("example_namespace", "users"))
print(tbl.metadata)
```

## Configuration and environment 🔧

- GCP authentication: Use `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` or Application Default Credentials
- `firestore_project` and `firestore_database` can be supplied when creating the catalog
- `gcs_bucket` is recommended to allow `create_dataset` to write metadata automatically; otherwise pass `location` explicitly to `create_dataset`
 - The catalog writes consolidated Parquet manifests and does not write manifest-list artifacts in the hot path. Use the provided export/import utilities for artifact conversion when necessary.

Example environment variables:

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/service-account.json"
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="my-gcp-project"
```

### Manifest format

This catalog writes consolidated Parquet manifests for fast query planning and stores table metadata in Firestore. Manifests and data files are stored in GCS. If you need different artifact formats, use the provided export/import utilities to convert manifests outside the hot path.

## API overview 📚

The package exports a factory helper `create_catalog` and the `FirestoreCatalog` class.

Key methods include:
- `create_collection(collection, properties={}, exists_ok=False)`
- `drop_namespace(namespace)`
- `list_namespaces()`
- `create_dataset(identifier, schema, location=None, partition_spec=None, sort_order=None, properties={})`
- `register_table(identifier, metadata_location)`
- `load_dataset(identifier)`
- `list_datasets(namespace)`
- `drop_dataset(identifier)`
- `rename_table(from_identifier, to_identifier)`
- `commit_table(table, requirements, updates)`
- `create_view(identifier, sql, schema=None, author=None, description=None, properties={})`
- `load_view(identifier)`
- `list_views(namespace)`
- `view_exists(identifier)`
- `drop_view(identifier)`
- `update_view_execution_metadata(identifier, row_count=None, execution_time=None)`

### Views 👁️

Views are SQL queries stored in the catalog that can be referenced like tables. Each view includes:
- **SQL statement**: The query that defines the view
- **Schema**: The expected result schema (optional but recommended)
- **Metadata**: Author, description, creation/update timestamps
- **Execution history**: Last run time, row count, execution time

Example usage:
```python
from pyiceberg.schema import Schema, NestedField
from pyiceberg.types import IntegerType, StringType

# Create a schema for the view
schema = Schema(
    NestedField(field_id=1, name="user_id", field_type=IntegerType(), required=True),
    NestedField(field_id=2, name="username", field_type=StringType(), required=False),
)

# Create a view
view = catalog.create_view(
    identifier=("my_namespace", "active_users"),
    sql="SELECT user_id, username FROM users WHERE active = true",
    schema=schema,
    author="data_team",
    description="View of all active users in the system"
)

# Load a view
view = catalog.load_view(("my_namespace", "active_users"))
print(f"SQL: {view.sql}")
print(f"Schema: {view.metadata.schema}")

# Update execution metadata after running the view
catalog.update_view_execution_metadata(
    ("my_namespace", "active_users"),
    row_count=1250,
    execution_time=0.45
)
```

Notes about behavior:
- `create_dataset` will try to infer a default GCS location using the provided `gcs_bucket` property if `location` is omitted.
- `register_table` validates that the provided `metadata_location` points to an existing GCS blob.
- Views are stored as Firestore documents with complete metadata including SQL, schema, authorship, and execution history.
- Table transactions are intentionally unimplemented.

## Development & Linting 🧪

This package includes a small `Makefile` target to run linting and formatting tools (`ruff`, `isort`, `pycln`).

Install dev tools and run linters with:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pycln isort ruff
make lint
```

Running tests (if you add tests):

```bash
python -m pytest
```

## Compaction 🔧

This catalog supports small file compaction to improve query performance. See [COMPACTION.md](COMPACTION.md) for detailed design documentation.

### Quick Start

```python
from pyiceberg_firestore_gcs import create_catalog
from pyiceberg_firestore_gcs.compaction import compact_table, get_compaction_stats

catalog = create_catalog(...)

# Check if compaction is needed
table = catalog.load_dataset(("namespace", "dataset_name"))
stats = get_compaction_stats(table)
print(f"Small files: {stats['small_file_count']}")

# Run compaction
result = compact_table(catalog, ("namespace", "table_name"))
print(f"Compacted {result.files_rewritten} files")
```

### Configuration

Control compaction behavior via table properties:

```python
table = catalog.create_dataset(
    identifier=("namespace", "table_name"),
    schema=schema,
    properties={
        "compaction.enabled": "true",
        "compaction.min-file-count": "10",
        "compaction.max-small-file-size-bytes": "33554432",  # 32 MB
        "write.target-file-size-bytes": "134217728"  # 128 MB
    }
)
```

## Limitations & KNOWN ISSUES ⚠️

- No support for dataset-level transactions. `create_dataset_transaction` raises `NotImplementedError`.
- The catalog stores metadata location references in Firestore; purging metadata files from GCS is not implemented.
- This is an opinionated implementation intended for internal or controlled environments. Review for production constraints before use in multi-tenant environments.
