# Importing Terms

You can import terminology from common formats such as TSV/CSV (and other supported glossary exports).

## Import steps

1. Open **Project resources → Glossaries**
2. Choose **Import**
3. Select your file

## Tips

- Clean your source file (consistent columns) before importing.
- Import before batch translation so AI can follow your terminology.

If you don’t see terms highlighting in the grid, ensure the glossary is enabled (Read/active) in Project resources.
{% endhint %}
