# Non-Translatables

Non-translatables are terms you want to keep unchanged (product names, IDs, codes, etc.).

## What you can do

- Maintain a list of non-translatable terms
- Highlight them in the grid
- Reduce accidental changes during editing

## Tips

- Add non-translatables before batch translation for best results.
- Use them for brand names, UI strings, and technical identifiers.
