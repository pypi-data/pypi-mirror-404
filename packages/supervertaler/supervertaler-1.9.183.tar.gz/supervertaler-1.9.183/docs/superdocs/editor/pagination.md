# Pagination

Pagination lets you work through large projects in pages (for example 50 segments at a time).

## Why use pagination

- Keeps the grid snappy on very large projects
- Helps you work in smaller review batches

## Navigation

Use the pagination controls to move between pages.

### Shortcuts

- **Page Up** → previous page
- **Page Down** → next page

{% hint style="info" %}
Go to Segment is pagination-aware: jumping to a segment on another page will switch pages automatically.
{% endhint %}
