# Editing & Confirming

Translate by editing the **Target** column in the grid.

## Editing

- Double-click a Target cell and type your translation.
- Use standard editing shortcuts (undo/redo, copy/paste, find/replace).

### Multi-line target text

- Use **Shift+Enter** to insert a line break inside the cell.

## Confirming segments

Confirming matters for many workflows, especially when exporting back to a CAT tool.

Typical workflow:

1. Translate (manual or AI)
2. Review the target text
3. Confirm the segment

### Confirm shortcuts

- **Ctrl+Enter**: confirm the current segment (or all selected segments) and move to the next unconfirmed segment.
- **Ctrl+Shift+Enter**: confirm all selected segments.

You can also confirm by setting the segment **Status** dropdown to a confirmed status.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you plan to reimport into a CAT tool, avoid merging/splitting content across segments.
{% endhint %}
