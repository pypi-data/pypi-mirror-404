# Filtering Segments

Filtering helps you focus on the segments you need right now.

## Common uses

- Show only segments that contain a specific term
- Focus on segments that need review
- Quickly find repeated strings and fix consistency

## Tip: filter on selection

A fast workflow is to select a word/phrase in the grid and use **Filter on selection**.

### Shortcut

- **Ctrl+Shift+F** toggles filtering:
	- If a filter is not active, it filters on the current selection.
	- If a filter is active, it clears the filter.

Filtering is designed to be fast even in large projects.
