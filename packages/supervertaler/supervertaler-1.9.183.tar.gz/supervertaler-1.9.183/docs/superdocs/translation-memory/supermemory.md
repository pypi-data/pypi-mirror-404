# Supermemory (Semantic Search)

Supermemory adds semantic (meaning-based) search across translation memory content.

## What it’s good for

- Finding relevant past translations even when wording differs
- Working with paraphrased or rewritten source text

## How to enable it

1. Open **Settings**
2. Find **Supermemory** settings
3. Enable Supermemory and let it build its index

Once enabled, use it from Superlookup (semantic tab/results).

## Tips

- Semantic search works best with a well-populated TM.
- Use it via [Superlookup](../superlookup/overview.md).
