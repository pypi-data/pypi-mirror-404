## Tips & Best Practices

### For Best Results
1. **Be specific**: "Create a legal contract prompt for EN→DE" beats "make a legal prompt"
2. **Provide context**: Attach style guides, reference documents, or examples
3. **Iterative refinement**: Start broad, then ask for specific improvements
4. **Use analysis**: Let the AI analyze your project first for tailored suggestions

### Workflow Integration
1. Start new project → Analyze with AI Assistant
2. Review suggested prompts → Save to library
3. Attach project-specific documents → Generate custom prompt
4. Test translations → Ask AI for prompt refinements

## Troubleshooting

**"AI Assistant not available"**
- Check API keys in Settings
- Ensure you have an active API key for OpenAI, Claude, or Gemini

**Slow responses**
- Large attached files increase processing time
