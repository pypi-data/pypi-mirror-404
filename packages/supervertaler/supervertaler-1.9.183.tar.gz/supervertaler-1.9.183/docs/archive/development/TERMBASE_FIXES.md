# Termbase System - Fixed & Working ✅

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Tab Label**
- ❌ Was: "📖 Glossaries"  
- ✅ Now: "📚 Term Bases"

### 2. **Database Initialization**
- ❌ Was: `db_manager` was never initialized
- ✅ Now: `db_manager` is created in `__init__()` with proper error handling
  - Connects on startup
  - Gracefully handles missing database
  - Safe logging before status bar exists

### 3. **Tab Loading**
- ❌ Was: Showed "Database not initialized" placeholder
- ✅ Now: Loads termbase list correctly when database is available

---

## Current Status

### ✅ Fully Working:
- **Tab renamed** to "📚 Term Bases"
- **Database loads** on startup
- **3 sample termbases** are populated and visible:
  - **Medical-NL-EN** (27 terms)
  - **Legal-NL-EN** (10 terms)
  - **Technical-NL-EN** (10 terms)
- **Termbase manager** fetches and displays all termbases
- **UI shows** termbase details (name, languages, term count, scope)

## How to Verify

### Option 1: Test Script (No GUI)
```powershell
cd c:\Dev\Supervertaler
python test_termbase.py
```

**Output shows:**
```
Found 3 termbases:
- Legal-NL-EN (nl → en, 10 terms)
- Medical-NL-EN (nl → en, 27 terms)
- Technical-NL-EN (nl → en, 10 terms)
```

### Option 2: Launch Full Application
```powershell
cd c:\Dev\Supervertaler
python Supervertaler_Qt.py
```

Then:
1. Click **"📚 Term Bases"** tab in Home panel
2. You should see:
   - Table with all 3 termbases listed
   - Activation checkboxes
   - Language pairs (nl → en)
   - Term counts (27, 10, 10)
   - Scope (Global)
   - Buttons: Create New, Import, Export, Delete, Edit Terms

  - Refactored `create_glossaries_tab()` (lines ~1243-1356)

- `modules/database_manager.py`
  - Added `termbases` table definition
  - Added `termbase_activation` table definition

### Created:
- `modules/termbase_manager.py` - Termbase manager class
- `create_sample_termbases.py` - Sample data script
- `test_termbase.py` - Testing script
- `docs/TERMBASE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Technical docs

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Recommended):
1. Launch the application
2. Navigate to **📚 Term Bases** tab
3. Verify you see the 3 sample termbases
4. Try creating a new termbase
5. Try activating/deactivating termbases for your project
6. Try editing terms in a termbase

### Phase 2 (Future):
- [ ] Terminology Search dialog (Ctrl+P style)
- [ ] Concordance Search dialog (Ctrl+K style)
- [ ] Import from CSV/Excel
- [ ] Export to TMX
- [ ] Color-coding by priority
- [ ] Advanced styling
