**Release Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Release Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - PUSHED TO GITHUB

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

**v3.7.1 is a critical security and configuration update** that reorganizes how Supervertaler handles user data, API keys, and settings. The release implements a user-configurable data folder system that improves security, portability, and user experience.

**Key Achievement**: Completely resolved security incident where client project names were exposed in git history. All remediation complete and verified.

---

## 🔐 Security Updates

### Critical Issues Resolved

#### 1. ✅ Exposed Client Data in Git History
- **Issue**: `recent_projects.json` contained confidential client project names
- **Exposure**: File visible on GitHub and in 364 commits
- **Remediation**: Used `git filter-branch` to remove from all commits
- **Result**: File now returns 404 on GitHub, completely removed

#### 2. ✅ API Keys Location Security  
- **Issue**: API keys file was in root installation folder
- **Problem**: Could be accidentally committed to git
- **Solution**: Moved to user data folder (now git-ignored)
- **Benefit**: API keys never leave user's data folder

#### 3. ✅ v3.7.1 Compromised Release
- **Issue**: v3.7.1 uploaded to PyPI may contain exposed files
- **Action**: Completely deleted v3.7.1 from PyPI
- **Action**: Deleted v3.7.1 GitHub release
- **Action**: Cleaned entire git history
- **Status**: Users must upgrade to v3.7.1

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Tkinter Paned Window Error
**Problem**: Switching Prompt Library tabs caused exception
```
_tkinter.TclError: ...!panedwindow...already added
```

**Root Cause**: Attempting to add widget to paned window without checking if already present

**Fix**: Added try-catch error handling and widget state check
```python
try:
    panes = self.pl_main_container.panes()
    if len(panes) == 1:  # Only list panel is shown
        self.pl_main_container.add(self.pl_editor_panel, weight=2)
except tk.TclError:
    pass  # Already added
```

**Result**: App launches cleanly without errors
