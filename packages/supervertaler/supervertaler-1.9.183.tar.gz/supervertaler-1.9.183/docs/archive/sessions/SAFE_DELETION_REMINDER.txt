⚠️ IMPORTANT: SAFE DELETION POLICY ⚠️
=====================================

NEVER delete files directly!
Always use the safe archive system first.

Archive Location: C:\Dev\Supervertaler_Archive\

Quick Commands:
--------------
# Archive single file
.\.dev\scripts\safe_archive.ps1 -Path "file.txt" -Reason "Why deleting"

# Archive multiple files
.\.dev\scripts\safe_archive_bulk.ps1 -Paths @("file1.txt", "file2.txt") -Reason "Cleanup"

Full documentation: .dev\scripts\README_SAFE_ARCHIVE.md

REMEMBER: 
- Files go to C:\Dev\Supervertaler_Archive (OUTSIDE this workspace)
- Include that folder in your Macrium backups!
- All archived files include metadata for easy recovery
