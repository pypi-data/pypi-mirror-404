# TM Match Pane Integration Checklist ✓

## Implementation Complete - October 29, 2025

### Core Components

#### ✅ 1. TMMatchPane Class
- [x] Class created in Supervertaler_Qt.py (lines 4679-4896)
- [x] Inherits from QWidget
- [x] Positioned before AutoFingersDialog class
- [x] All methods implemented:
  - [x] `__init__()`: Initialize with parent
  - [x] `setup_ui()`: Create all UI elements
  - [x] `display_match()`: Show match with styling
  - [x] `show_no_match()`: Show waiting placeholder
  - [x] `clear()`: Reset to initial state

#### ✅ 2. UI Components in TMMatchPane
- [x] Header label: "📊 Current Match"
- [x] Source segment display (QTextEdit, read-only)
  - [x] Light gray background (#F5F5F5)
  - [x] Displays source text
- [x] Match info section:
  - [x] Match percentage label
  - [x] Dynamic color coding
  - [x] Match type badge (QLabel with styles)
- [x] Target translation display (QTextEdit)
  - [x] Exact: Green background (#E8F5E9)
  - [x] Fuzzy: Orange background (#FFF3E0)
  - [x] No match: Red background (#FFEBEE)
- [x] Waiting state: "⏳ Waiting for segment..."

#### ✅ 3. Layout Refactoring
- [x] Refactored `create_control_tab()` (lines 5074-5164)
- [x] Changed from vertical to horizontal layout
- [x] Left side (2/3 width):
  - [x] TMX file selection group
  - [x] TMX status label
  - [x] Actions group with:
    - [x] Process single button
    - [x] Loop mode button with spinbox
    - [x] Progress label
    - [x] Progress bar
- [x] Right side (1/3 width):
  - [x] TMMatchPane widget instance
  - [x] Minimum width set to 300px
- [x] Proper layout proportions (2:1 ratio)

#### ✅ 4. Engine Integration
- [x] Added `last_source` attribute to AutoFingersEngine.__init__() (line 86)
- [x] Added `last_match` attribute to AutoFingersEngine.__init__() (line 87)
- [x] Updated `process_single_segment()` to track:
  - [x] Sets `self.last_source = source_text` (line 250)
  - [x] Sets `self.last_match = match_result` (line 251)

#### ✅ 5. UI Updates - Single Mode
- [x] Updated `process_single()` method (lines 5329-5357)
- [x] Resets match pane at start: `self.match_pane.show_no_match()`
- [x] Displays match after processing:
  - [x] Checks if `self.engine.last_source` exists
  - [x] Checks if `self.engine.last_match` exists
  - [x] Calls `self.match_pane.display_match()`

#### ✅ 6. UI Updates - Loop Mode
- [x] Updated `run_loop()` method (lines 5402-5421)
- [x] Updates match pane for each segment:
  - [x] Uses `QTimer.singleShot()` for thread safety
  - [x] Extracts `self.engine.last_source`
  - [x] Extracts `self.engine.last_match`
  - [x] Calls `self.match_pane.display_match()`
- [x] Updates happen in-thread-safe manner

### Functionality Testing

#### ✅ Match Display Logic
- [x] Exact matches (100%):
  - [x] Displays with green background
  - [x] Shows "✓ EXACT" badge
  - [x] Shows "100%" percentage
- [x] Fuzzy matches (80-99%):
  - [x] Displays with orange background
  - [x] Shows "~ FUZZY" badge
  - [x] Shows actual percentage (e.g., "97%")
- [x] No matches:
  - [x] Displays with red background
  - [x] Shows "✗ NO MATCH" badge
  - [x] Shows no percentage

#### ✅ State Transitions
- [x] Initial state shows "Waiting for segment..."
- [x] After processing shows match result
- [x] `clear()` returns to waiting state
- [x] Transitions are instantaneous

#### ✅ Color Coding
- [x] Source segment: Light gray (#F5F5F5)
- [x] Exact match: Green (#E8F5E9)
- [x] Fuzzy match: Orange (#FFF3E0)
- [x] No match: Red (#FFEBEE)
- [x] All colors verified in code
