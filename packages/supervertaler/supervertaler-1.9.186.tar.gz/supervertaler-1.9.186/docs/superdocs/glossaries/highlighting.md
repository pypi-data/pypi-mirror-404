# Term Highlighting

When a glossary is active, Supervertaler highlights matching terms in the grid.

## Why it helps

- Prevents terminology drift
- Speeds up review
- Makes it obvious when a preferred term exists

## Tips

- If the highlight is too strong or too subtle, adjust it in [View Settings](../settings/view.md).
- Tag highlighting and glossary highlighting are separate: tags are for placeholders/formatting, glossaries are for terminology.
