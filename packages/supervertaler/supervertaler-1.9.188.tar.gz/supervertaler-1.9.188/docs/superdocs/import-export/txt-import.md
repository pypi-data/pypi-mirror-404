# Importing Text Files

Text import is the simplest workflow: **each line becomes one segment**.

## Import steps

1. Go to **File → Import → Text File...**
2. Select your `.txt` file
3. Choose the **source** and **target** languages

## Tips

- Keep one sentence (or one logical unit) per line for best results.
- If your file has encoding issues (weird characters), try saving it as UTF-8.

## Export

Text projects can be exported as:

- Translated TXT
- DOCX
- Bilingual table
