# Bilingual Tables

A bilingual table is a side-by-side **Source | Target** export that’s useful for review and handoff.

## When to use it

- Quick review in Word
- Sharing with a reviewer who doesn’t use your CAT tool
- Basic side-by-side delivery formats

## Notes

- Bilingual tables are not always suitable for CAT tool reimport.
- For round-trips, prefer the dedicated CAT exchange formats described in [CAT Tool Overview](../cat-tools/overview.md).
