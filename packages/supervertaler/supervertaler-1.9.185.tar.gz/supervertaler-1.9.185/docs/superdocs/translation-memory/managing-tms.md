# Creating & Managing TMs

Translation Memories (TMs) help you reuse past translations.

## Add or create a TM

1. Open **Project resources → Translation Memories**
2. Add an existing TM (or create a new one)
3. Enable **Read** to use it for matches
4. Enable **Write** if you want new translations saved into it

## Using TM matches

- TM matches appear automatically as you navigate.
- You can insert matches quickly:
	- **Ctrl+1…9** inserts match #1…#9
	- **Ctrl+Space** inserts the currently selected match

## Tips

- Keep separate TMs per client or domain if needed.
- Ensure the TM language pair matches your project.
- If a segment contains tags/placeholders, keep them intact when inserting a match.
