# 🎉 New Specialized Module: Professional TMX Editor

We're excited to announce a new specialized module for Supervertaler: **TMX Editor**!

## What is it?

A powerful, professional Translation Memory eXchange (TMX) editor inspired by the legendary Heartsome TMX Editor. It provides a fast, user-friendly interface for editing translation memory files with advanced features like:

- ✨ **Dual-language grid editor** - Edit source and target side-by-side
- 🔍 **Real-time search highlighting** - See your search terms highlighted in the grid
- 💾 **Database-backed large file support** - Handle files larger than 1GB efficiently
- ✏️ **Inline editing** - Edit directly in the grid, no popups needed
- 📊 **Advanced filtering** - Filter by language, content, with smart auto mode selection

## How to use it

**Standalone mode:**
```bash
python modules/tmx_editor_qt.py
```

**Integrated mode:**
- Available as a tab in Supervertaler Qt Edition (v1.1.0+)
- Accessible from the main application's TMX Editor tab

## What's next?

This module demonstrates our vision for **modular, specialized tools** that can run independently or be integrated into Supervertaler. We're building towards a system where modules can be activated/deactivated at startup, creating customized versions of Supervertaler for different workflows.

**Have ideas for other specialized modules?** Request them here in the [Modules Discussions](https://github.com/michaelbeijer/Supervertaler/discussions/categories/modules)!
