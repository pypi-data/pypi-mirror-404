## About Supervertaler

### What is Supervertaler?

Supervertaler is a context-aware, LLM-powered translation and proofreading tool designed specifically for professional translators. It leverages multiple AI providers (OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini) and multiple context sources (translation memory, tracked changes, custom instructions, full document context) to deliver highly accurate translations that maintain consistency and domain expertise.

### What does "Supervertaler" mean?

**Supervertaler** is Dutch for "super translator" (*super* = super, *vertaler* = translator). 

The name reflects the creator's Dutch-American heritage and adds a bit of international flair to a tool designed for translators worldwide. It's also delightfully straightforward – no clever acronyms, no marketing gymnastics, just a Dutch word that does exactly what it says on the tin: translates, superbly.

Plus, it's fun to say. Try it: *"Soo-per-ver-TAH-ler"*. See? You're smiling already. 😊

### Who created Supervertaler?

Supervertaler was created by **Michael Beijer**, a professional translator and language technology enthusiast, with assistance from AI coding assistants. The project represents a collaboration between human expertise in translation workflows and AI capabilities in software development.

**Website**: [michaelbeijer.co.uk](https://michaelbeijer.co.uk/)  
**GitHub**: [github.com/michaelbeijer/Supervertaler](https://github.com/michaelbeijer/Supervertaler)

### How does Supervertaler compare to other translation tools?

**vs. Machine Translation (Google Translate, DeepL)**:
- ✅ **Context-aware**: Uses full document context, not just individual sentences
- ✅ **Customizable**: Custom instructions, system prompts, terminology management
- ✅ **TM integration**: Leverages translation memory for consistency
- ✅ **Professional control**: Inline editing, status tracking, project management

**vs. Traditional CAT Tools (memoQ, Trados)**:
- ✅ **AI-powered**: LLM translation with contextual understanding
- ✅ **Flexible AI**: Choose between OpenAI, Claude, Gemini
- ✅ **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface with multiple view modes
- ⚠️ **Complementary tool**: Works *with* CAT tools via bilingual DOCX, not as replacement

### What makes Supervertaler different? (The AI-First Philosophy)

**Traditional CAT tools** rely heavily on rule-based systems:
- Complex regex patterns for text processing
- Rigid QA rules that must be manually configured
- Fixed workflows that require technical knowledge to customize
- Limited by what developers anticipated users would need

**Supervertaler's AI-First Approach**:
Instead of writing countless rules, we simply ask the AI in natural language:

- **QA Example**: Instead of configuring dozens of QA rules, just ask: *"Run QA on my translation. Check for consistency, terminology accuracy, and formatting issues."*
  
- **Text Processing Example**: Instead of writing complex regex patterns, describe what you want: *"Extract all figure references and create a numbered list"* or *"Convert all product codes to uppercase and add hyphens every 4 characters"*

- **Custom Workflows Example**: Instead of being limited to predefined features, describe your need: *"Flag all segments containing measurements and suggest metric conversions"* or *"Identify segments with legal terminology and mark them for expert review"*

**The Power of Natural Language Control**:
- 🎯 **Intuitive**: Describe tasks in plain English instead of learning rule syntax
- 🚀 **Flexible**: Adapt workflows on-the-fly without software updates
- 🧠 **Contextual**: AI understands nuance and context that rigid rules miss
- ⚡ **Efficient**: Accomplish complex tasks with simple instructions

**Example - Traditional vs AI-First**:

*Traditional CAT Tool QA*:
```
✗ Configure: Number consistency check
✗ Configure: Terminology variance check  
✗ Configure: Tag presence validation
✗ Configure: Punctuation matching
✗ Configure: Length ratio limits
... (dozens more rules)
```

*Supervertaler AI-First QA*:
```
✓ "Run comprehensive QA on this translation. Focus on:
   - Consistency with translation memory
   - Proper use of client terminology
   - Tag preservation and formatting
   - Natural flow in target language
   - Technical accuracy for patent content"
```

The AI understands the intent, applies contextual judgment, and adapts to your specific project needs—all without rigid rule configuration.

This philosophy extends beyond QA to every aspect of translation work: prompt engineering replaces rule configuration, natural language replaces regex, and AI reasoning replaces rigid algorithms.

### How does context provision work?

Supervertaler provides AI with **multiple layers of context**:

1. **Full Document Context**: Entire source document text (not just current sentence)
2. **Translation Memory**: Fuzzy matches from TMX files
3. **Custom Instructions**: Project-specific guidelines
4. **System Prompt**: Domain specialist role (medical, legal, patent, etc.)
5. **Tracked Changes**: Editing patterns from previous work
6. **Image Context** (v2.5.0-CLASSIC): Technical drawings and figures
7. **Segment Metadata**: Type, style, neighboring segments

**Why this matters**:
- AI understands document flow and terminology
- Maintains consistency throughout translation
- Adapts to your specific style and preferences
- Reduces ambiguity and improves accuracy
- Specialized domain knowledge applied

### What file formats are supported?

**Import formats**:
- **DOCX**: Microsoft Word documents
- **Bilingual DOCX**: CafeTran and memoQ formats
- **TXT**: Plain text (paragraph-based or line-based)
- **TMX**: Translation memory exchange format
- **TSV**: Tab-separated values
- **JSON**: Project files with segment data

**Export formats**:
- **DOCX**: Microsoft Word documents (with formatting)
- **Bilingual DOCX**: CafeTran (pipes as BOLD+RED), memoQ (formatted tables)
- **TMX**: Translation memory export
- **TSV**: Spreadsheet-compatible export
- **XLIFF**: XML localization format
- **Excel** (XLSX): Spreadsheet with metadata (v3.x only)
- **MD/HTML**: Session reports with statistics

### How is formatting preserved?

**CafeTran (AI-Based)**:
- Pipe symbols `|text|` mark formatted sections
- AI contextually places pipes in translation
- Handles word reordering intelligently
- Exported with pipes as BOLD + RED for visibility
- Reimport to CafeTran preserves formatting

**memoQ (Programmatic)**:
- Bold, italic, underline tracked algorithmically
- Character-level formatting extracted before translation
- Translation occurs on clean text
- Formatting reapplied to translation using alignment
- 100% accuracy on bold/italic/underline preservation

**Standard DOCX**:
- Paragraph styles preserved
- Basic formatting (bold, italic) maintained where possible
- Complex formatting may require manual review

### Can I use Supervertaler offline?

**No** - Supervertaler requires:
- Internet connection for AI API calls (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)
- Active API keys with credit/subscription

**Why online-only**:
- AI models run on provider servers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- No local AI models supported currently
- Context and processing require cloud AI infrastructure

**Future consideration**:
- Local model support (Ollama, LM Studio) possible in future versions
- Would enable offline usage with reduced capability
- Not currently implemented

## Data Privacy & Confidentiality

**IMPORTANT**: This section addresses the critical concern many professional translators have about using any online translation tool, especially when handling confidential client documents.

### Is my data safe when using Supervertaler?

**Short Answer**: It depends on what you mean by "safe":

**✅ Supervertaler itself**:
- Runs entirely on YOUR computer (no Supervertaler company server)
- No data collection, telemetry, or analytics
- Fully open source (code is auditable)
- API keys never stored or transmitted by Supervertaler
- Translation memory, glossaries, custom instructions stay 100% local

**⚠️ When using external LLM APIs**:
- Your text MUST reach the LLM provider's servers (that's how AI translation works)
- This is unavoidable if you want to use GPT-4, Claude, or Gemini
- You're trusting the LLM provider's data handling practices
- This is different from offline/local translation tools

### When I click "Translate," what exactly happens to my data?

**Step-by-step process**:

1. **You select text** in Supervertaler
2. **Context is gathered** locally:
   - The text you selected
   - Relevant TM matches (from YOUR local TM file)
   - Custom instructions and prompts
   - Document context if enabled
3. **Formatted request is created** locally
4. **Request sent to LLM provider** via HTTPS (encrypted)
   - OpenAI servers receive: `{source_text, system_prompt, instructions, optional_context}`
   - Anthropic servers receive: `{source_text, system_prompt, instructions, optional_context}`
   - Google servers receive: `{source_text, system_prompt, instructions, optional_context}`
5. **AI generates translation** on provider's infrastructure
6. **Response returned** to your computer via HTTPS
7. **Translation stored locally** (NOT on Supervertaler's server)

**Critical Point**: Steps 4-6 mean your content briefly exists on the provider's systems. This is the tradeoff for using powerful cloud-based AI.

### What do the LLM providers do with my data?

**OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-4o)**:
- **Default**: API data NOT used for training or model improvement
- **Enterprise plans**: Explicit zero-retention guarantees available
- **Data Processing Agreement**: Available for business customers
- **Compliance**: SOC 2 Type II, GDPR compliant
- **Your responsibility**: Review their terms, ensure enterprise plan if needed

**Anthropic (Claude)**:
- **Default**: API data NOT used for training
- **Policy**: Explicit "no data retention for training" commitment
- **Compliance**: SOC 2 Type II compliant
- **Enterprise**: Data processing agreements available
- **Best for confidentiality**: Generally considered most privacy-friendly

**Google Generative AI**:
- **Default**: Privacy practices vary by product
- **Enterprise plans**: Enhanced data protection available
- **Compliance**: SOC 2, GDPR options available
- **Your responsibility**: Verify your chosen Google product's specific terms

**All providers**:
- Comply with data residency requirements (GDPR, regional laws)
- Offer data processing agreements (DPAs) for business users
- Have documented security practices (HTTPS encryption, data centers)
- Support SOC 2 Type II or equivalent compliance

### What should I do for NDA/Confidential Work?

**If you're translating under NDA or with strictly confidential documents:**

**Recommended approach** (Required by most translation agencies for AI):

1. **Use Enterprise/Business Plans**
   - Most AI providers have specific enterprise products
   - Much stricter data protection than consumer/developer API
   - Often include zero-retention guarantees

2. **Get a Data Processing Agreement (DPA)**
   - Signed agreement with the LLM provider
   - Specifies data handling, retention, usage
   - Usually available through enterprise accounts
   - Shows your client you took data protection seriously

3. **Verify Key Guarantees**:
   - ✓ Zero data retention (data deleted after processing)
   - ✓ No use for training or model improvement
   - ✓ No use for other purposes
   - ✓ Data not shared with third parties
   - ✓ Secure transmission (HTTPS)
   - ✓ Encryption at rest (if applicable)

4. **Document Your Setup**
   - Keep copy of DPA with your records
   - Document which AI provider you're using
   - Note: You can use different providers for different projects
   - Share relevant parts with your client (privacy-focused ones appreciate this)

5. **Alternative for Maximum Confidentiality**:
   - Use only local/offline translation components
   - This means NOT using AI translation (since all major AI requires cloud transmission)
   - Use Supervertaler for TM, glossary, and CAT tool integration only
   - Do translation with your own local translation engine (if available)

### Are there any tools that keep data completely local?

**For AI Translation**: 
- ❌ **No major LLM platform keeps AI models running locally** (as of October 2025)
- Even "local" AI applications typically need cloud connectivity for actual translation
- This is because GPT-4, Claude, Gemini are only available on providers' servers
- Running large language models locally requires significant hardware and is impractical for most users

**Partial solutions**:
- **Local TM + Manual Translation**: Use Supervertaler's local TM with your own translations (no AI)
- **Offline TM Tools**: Many traditional CAT tools have fully local operation
- **Future**: Open-source local LLMs may improve, but current ones are significantly weaker than GPT-4/Claude

**For Most Professional Translators**:
- Accept that modern AI translation requires cloud transmission
- Get proper data processing agreements in place
- Use enterprise/business API plans for confidential work
- This is industry standard now (not specific to Supervertaler)

### How do I protect my data when using Supervertaler with AI?

**Best Practices**:

1. **API Key Security**:
   - ✓ Keep `api_keys.txt` secure (don't share, not in version control)
   - ✓ Regenerate keys if accidentally exposed
   - ✓ Use separate API keys for different projects (if needed)
   - ✓ Monitor API key usage/costs regularly

2. **Document Handling**:
   - ✓ Don't store confidential originals in Supervertaler projects
   - ✓ Delete projects/documents after delivery
   - ✓ Keep `user data/` folder secure (local disk encryption recommended)
   - ✓ Separate projects: One folder per client for organization

3. **Translation Memory**:
   - ✓ TM files stay 100% local
   - ✓ Don't share TM files with cloud services
   - ✓ Back up TM securely (encrypted if on cloud storage)
   - ✓ Treat TM as confidential (it contains all your work)

4. **Provider Selection**:
   - ✓ Choose Anthropic or OpenAI for strongest privacy defaults
   - ✓ Use enterprise plans for confidential work
   - ✓ Get written DPA from provider
   - ✓ Review provider's security practices

5. **Organizational Level**:
   - ✓ Document your data protection process
   - ✓ Communicate with clients about your AI usage and safeguards
   - ✓ Keep copies of relevant DPAs
   - ✓ Update privacy policies if you're an agency

### Can I tell my clients I use Supervertaler?

**Yes, and here's how to present it professionally**:

**What to say**:
- "I use professional AI-powered translation assistance (GPT-4 / Claude / Gemini) as part of my quality assurance and productivity process"
- "All AI translations are reviewed by me before delivery"
- "AI is used within secure enterprise data processing agreements"
- "Your data is protected by [Provider Name] enterprise data processing agreement"
- "No data is retained or used for training by the AI provider"

**What NOT to say**:
- ❌ "I use free/online translation tools" (implies lower quality, risky data handling)
- ❌ "I use Supervertaler" (clients don't know what it is, creates uncertainty)
- ❌ "My data might be used for AI training" (scary, inaccurate)

**Practical tip**:
- Many modern translation clients actually WANT you using AI (when properly secured)
- Demonstrates productivity and modern workflow
- Shows quality assurance capability
- Clients appreciate transparency + proper safeguards

### What about GDPR and other regulations?

**GDPR Compliance (EU)**:
- If translating EU personal data, GDPR applies
- LLM providers must have GDPR-compliant Data Processing Agreements
- Both OpenAI, Anthropic, Google offer GDPR-compliant enterprise plans
- You need a DPA signed before processing personal data

**Other Regulations**:
- **HIPAA** (US healthcare): Must use HIPAA-compliant AI provider plan
- **PCI-DSS** (payment data): Use PCI-compliant provider plans
- **CCPA** (California privacy): Similar to GDPR, need proper agreements

**What to do**:
1. Identify applicable regulations for your work
2. Verify LLM provider supports that regulation
3. Get proper enterprise plan + DPA
4. Document your compliance process
5. Keep records for audit purposes

### This seems complicated. What's the real bottom line?

**For translators**:

**If working with general/public-domain content**:
- Standard OpenAI/Anthropic API + default terms = fine
- No special precautions needed beyond basic API key security
- Cost-effective solution

**If working with client confidential content**:
- Must use enterprise API plan + Data Processing Agreement
- Takes 15-30 minutes to set up
- Protects you AND your client
- Allows you to use AI professionally without legal risk

**If working with heavily regulated content** (healthcare, legal, finance):
- Need regulation-specific enterprise plan (HIPAA, legal compliance, etc.)
- Longer setup (provider verification, agreement review)
- Worth it for client relationships and legal protection

**If working with highly secret/military/government classified**:
- ❌ Cannot use cloud AI at all
- Use only offline/local tools
- This is extremely rare in translation work

**For 95% of freelance translators**:
- Set up enterprise plan with Anthropic or OpenAI (15 min)
- Get DPA (if working with client confidential data)
- Use confidently = better workflow, faster delivery, competitive advantage

## Troubleshooting

### Why is translation slow?

**Common causes**:
1. **Large chunk size**: Reduce chunk size in settings (default: 20 → try 10)
2. **Provider rate limits**: Some providers throttle requests
3. **Model choice**: Slower models (GPT-4, Claude Opus) take longer
4. **Large context**: Full document + TM + images = more tokens = slower
5. **Internet speed**: Slow connection affects API response time

**Solutions**:
- Use faster models (Gemini Flash, Claude Haiku)
- Reduce chunk size
- Disable unnecessary context sources
- Switch to better internet connection
- Consider batch processing overnight

### API errors - what do they mean?

**"Invalid API Key"**:
- Check `api_keys.txt` for typos
- Ensure key format is correct (starts with `sk-` for OpenAI/Claude)
- Verify key is active on provider dashboard
- Check key has not expired

**"Rate Limit Exceeded"**:
- Too many requests in short time
- Wait a few minutes before retrying
- Reduce chunk size to make fewer requests
- Upgrade API plan for higher limits

**"Context Length Exceeded"**:
- Document + context too large for model
- Reduce chunk size
- Disable image context if not needed
- Use model with larger context window (Gemini 1.5 Pro: 2M tokens)

**"Insufficient Credits"**:
- API account out of credits
- Add funds to provider account
- Check billing settings on provider dashboard

### Formatting is lost in export

**CafeTran**:
- Ensure pipe symbols `|text|` are preserved in target
- Check export uses "☕ Export to CafeTran DOCX" button (not generic export)
- Verify pipes appear as BOLD + RED in exported file
- If pipes missing, AI may have removed them - edit manually

**memoQ**:
- Use "📊 Export to memoQ DOCX" button (not generic export)
- Check source DOCX had formatting to begin with
- Formatting only preserved if present in original
- Manual formatting may be needed for complex styles

**General**:
- Some formatting may not survive translation (by design)
- Review exported file before reimporting to CAT tool
- Keep backup of original source file
- Report formatting issues on GitHub for investigation

### Program crashes or freezes

**Immediate solutions**:
- Force quit and restart program
- Check for unsaved work (projects auto-save periodically)
- Review log panel for error messages before crash

**Preventing future crashes**:
- Update Python to latest version
- Update libraries: `pip install --upgrade openai anthropic google-generativeai pillow python-docx openpyxl`
- Reduce chunk size for large documents
- Close other programs to free memory
- Check for antivirus interference
- Report crash with error message on GitHub Issues

**Data recovery**:
- Check `user data/Projects/` for auto-saved project
- Check `user data/` for exported files (TMX, session reports)
- Source files are never modified (always safe)

### How do I report a bug?

1. **Gather information**:
   - Supervertaler version (v2.5.0-CLASSIC or v3.7.0)
   - Python version (`python --version`)
   - Operating system and version
   - Error message (from log panel or console)
   - Steps to reproduce the bug

2. **GitHub Issues**:
