## Feature Scope: General Professional Use

The Style Guides feature is designed for **any professional task**, including:

✅ **Translation** - Formatting rules, terminology, conventions  
✅ **Proofreading** - Style consistency, error categories, quality markers  
✅ **Localization** - Regional conventions, cultural adaptations, market-specific rules  
✅ **Copywriting** - Brand voice, tone guidelines, messaging rules  
(Future expansion as features are added to Supervertaler)

## Implementation Approach

### Architecture
```
User Actions (UI)
    ↓
Tab Handlers (_on_style_guide_*)
    ↓
Backend Methods (StyleGuideLibrary)
    ↓
File Operations (Disk Storage)
```

### Key Components Ready
- ✅ Backend (StyleGuideLibrary)
- ✅ Data (5 language guides)
- ✅ UI Framework (3-panel layout)
- ✅ Button handlers (save, load, export, import)
- ✅ Chat interface (input/output)

### Components to Enhance
- 🔄 Batch operations logic
- 🔄 AI integration
- 🔄 Command parsing
- 🔄 Error handling

---

## Next Steps (What We'll Do)

### Step 1: Enhance Batch Operations (1-2 hours)
- Implement "Add to all languages" functionality
- Test with all 5 languages
- Verify data persistence

### Step 2: AI Integration (2-3 hours)
- Connect to PromptAssistant
- Create AI system prompt for style guides
- Handle AI responses in chat

### Step 3: Smart Command Parsing (1-2 hours)
- Parse user chat commands
- Extract language and text
- Route to appropriate handlers

### Step 4: Testing & Polish (1-2 hours)
- Comprehensive testing
- UI refinement
- Documentation

**Total Estimated Time:** 5-9 hours

## Architecture Summary

### Three-Panel Layout
```
┌─────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
│   Left      │    Center    │    Right     │
│ Language    │ Guide Editor │ AI Chat      │
│ List        │              │ Interface    │
│             │ • Save       │              │
│ • Load      │ • Import     │ • Commands   │
│ • Add All   │ • Export     │ • Responses  │
└─────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘
```

### Data Flow
```
Guides on Disk
    ↑
    ├── Load → Display in Editor
    ├── Save ← Modified in Editor
    ├── Export → File System
    └── Import ← File System

Chat Commands
    ↑
    ├── Parse: "add to all: text"
    ├── Execute: append_to_all_guides()
    └── Response: Display in chat
```

## Development Notes

### Key Insights
- Backend is 100% complete and tested
- UI framework is in place and functional
- All basic operations have handlers ready
- Integration with AI is straightforward via existing PromptAssistant
- Batch operations need careful testing with all 5 languages

### Potential Challenges
- Encoding issues with special characters (being monitored)
- Chat command parsing must be robust
- Need to handle edge cases in file operations
- Error messages must be user-friendly

### Best Practices Applied
- Follows existing Supervertaler patterns
- Uses consistent naming conventions
- Proper error handling with try/except
- User feedback via messagebox and status bar
- Modular code design
