   User: "Make this prompt more formal"
   AI: Modifies tone throughout → Shows changes → User applies
   
   User: "Add a rule about preserving measurement units"
   AI: Adds specific instruction → Shows where inserted → User accepts
   ```

3. **Technical Components:**
   - Chat UI with scrollable history
   - LLM integration (reuse existing OpenAI/Anthropic/Google connections)
   - Diff visualization using `difflib`

### Phase 2: Document-Aware Prompt Generation (MEDIUM - 10-15 hours)

**Goal:** AI analyzes current document to suggest optimal prompts

**Features:**
1. **Analyze Document** button
   - AI examines source text segments
   - Detects domain (legal, medical, technical, etc.)
   - Identifies terminology patterns
   - Suggests appropriate base prompt
   - Offers customizations based on content

2. **Example Interaction:**
   ```
   User: Loads pharmaceutical patent document
   User: "Create a prompt for this document"
   AI: "I've analyzed your document. It appears to be a pharmaceutical 
        patent with chemical nomenclature and regulatory language. 
        I recommend starting with the Patent Translation prompt with 
        these modifications:
        - Emphasis on IUPAC chemical naming
        - Preservation of regulatory references
        - Formal technical tone
        Would you like me to create this prompt?"
   User: "Yes, but also add attention to measurement units"
   AI: Creates customized prompt → Shows content → User applies
   ```

3. **Document Analysis:**
   - Extract terminology frequency
   - Detect formatting patterns (lists, tables, headings)
   - Identify special elements (figures, equations, references)
   - Assess tone and formality level
   - Recognise domain-specific patterns

### Phase 3: Edit-Based Learning (HARD - 30-40 hours)

**Goal:** System learns from user edits to suggest prompt improvements

**Features:**
1. **Edit Tracking System**
   - Monitors every translation edit during work session
   - Categorizes edits: terminology, style, formatting, corrections
   - Aggregates patterns across segments
   - Stores edit history per project/domain

2. **Pattern Analysis:**
   ```python
   Detected Patterns:
   - Terminology: "color" → "colour" (50 instances) → UK English preference
   - Style: User adds "please" to imperatives (12 instances) → Polite tone
   - Formatting: Removes extra spaces (35 instances) → Strict formatting
   - Corrections: "program" → "programme" (18 instances) → UK spelling
   ```

3. **AI-Generated Suggestions:**
   ```
   AI: "I've noticed patterns in your edits:
       
       1. You consistently use UK English spelling
          → Update Patent prompt to specify 'en-GB'?
          
       2. You prefer formal medical terminology over common terms
          → Add instruction: 'Use formal medical terminology'?
          
       3. You remove 'respectively' when translating lists
          → Add rule: 'Avoid redundant 'respectively' in lists'?
       
       Apply these improvements? [Select All] [Review Each] [Dismiss]"
   ```

4. **Learning Categories:**
   - **Terminology Preferences:** Consistent word choice changes
   - **Style Rules:** Tone, formality, voice patterns
   - **Formatting Fixes:** Spacing, punctuation, structure
   - **Domain Patterns:** Subject-specific conventions
