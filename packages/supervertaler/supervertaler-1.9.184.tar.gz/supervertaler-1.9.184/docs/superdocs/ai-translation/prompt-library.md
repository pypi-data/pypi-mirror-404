# Prompt Library

Supervertaler includes a prompt library so you can reuse prompts across projects.

## Common uses

- Maintain different prompts per client
- Maintain different prompts per domain
- Switch between “draft” and “final” translation styles

## Tips

- Start simple and evolve prompts as you learn what works for your language pair.

## External prompts

If you load a prompt from an external file (outside the built-in library), Supervertaler can show it in the editor and save changes back to the same file.
