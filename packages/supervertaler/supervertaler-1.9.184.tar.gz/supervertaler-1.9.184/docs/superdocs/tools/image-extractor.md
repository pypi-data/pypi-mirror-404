# Image Extractor (Superimage)

The Image Extractor pulls embedded images out of DOCX files and saves them as numbered PNG files. It also includes a built-in preview so you can quickly review what was extracted.

## Where to find it

- **Tools → Image Extractor (Superimage)...**
- Or: **Project resources** → **🎯 Image Context** (the Image Extractor lives in the bottom section of that tab)

## Extract images from a DOCX

1. Add input files:
	- **📄 Add File** to pick DOCX files
	- **📁 Folder** to add all DOCX files from a folder
2. Choose an output strategy:
	- Enable **📁 Auto-folder** to create an `Images` folder next to each DOCX
	- Or set a single output directory in the **Output directory** field
3. Set **Prefix** (default `Fig.`).
4. Click **🖼️ Extract Images**.
5. Use **📂 Extracted Files (click to preview)** to preview images.

## Using extracted images as AI context

If you also use **Image Context**, you can load a folder of figures so Supervertaler can attach relevant images automatically during AI translation (for example when the text references “Figure 2A”).

Image Extractor is about getting the images out of DOCX. Image Context is about feeding those images into AI translation when needed.
