# PDF Rescue - AI-Powered OCR Tool

**Part of [Supervertaler](https://supervertaler.com/) • by Michael Beijer**

## 📖 Overview

**PDF Rescue** is a specialised AI-powered OCR tool designed to extract clean, editable text from poorly formatted PDFs. Built into Supervertaler, it uses vision-capable LLM OCR to intelligently recognise text, formatting, redactions, stamps, and signatures—producing professional, translator-ready documents.

### 🎯 The Problem It Solves

Have you ever received a PDF translation job where:
- The text won't copy-paste cleanly?
- Line breaks are all over the place?
- Formatting is completely broken?
- Traditional OCR produces gibberish?
- Redacted sections show as black boxes?
- Stamps and signatures clutter the text?

**PDF Rescue fixes all of this.**

###  Real-World Success Story

> *"I had a client reach out for a rush job—a 4-page legal document that had clearly been scanned badly. Traditional OCR couldn't handle it, and manual retyping would have taken hours.*
> 
> *I used PDF Rescue's one-click PDF import, processed all 4 pages with AI OCR, and it produced a flawless Word document that I could immediately start working with. What would have been a multi-day nightmare became a straightforward job I could deliver on time.*
> 
> *I was able to tell my client that I could handle the job—and delivered professional quality. PDF Rescue literally saved a client relationship."*
