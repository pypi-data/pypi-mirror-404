# Multi-File Projects

Multi-file projects let you import a whole folder of files as a single Supervertaler project.

## Import a folder

1. Go to **File → Import → Folder (Multiple Files)...**
2. Choose a folder containing supported files (DOCX/TXT)
3. Select which files to include
4. Choose the **source** and **target** languages

## How it behaves

- All segments live in one grid, but each segment is associated with a source file.
- You can jump between files and track progress per file.

## Tips

- Use this when you receive a set of small files (e.g., UI strings split across documents).
- Export can be done per-file into a destination folder.
