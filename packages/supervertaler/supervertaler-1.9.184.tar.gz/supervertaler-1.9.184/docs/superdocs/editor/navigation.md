# Navigating Segments

Supervertaler is designed for fast, memoQ-style navigation in the translation grid.

## Moving between segments

- Use the arrow keys to move within a cell.
- When your cursor is at the **top** or **bottom** line of a cell, **Up/Down** can jump to the previous/next segment.

### Always move up/down

If you want to move between segments regardless of where the cursor is inside the cell:

- **Alt+Up** → previous segment
- **Alt+Down** → next segment

### Jump to a segment

- **Ctrl+G** opens **Go to Segment**.
- Type a segment number and press Enter.

### Jump to start/end

- **Ctrl+Home** → first segment
- **Ctrl+End** → last segment

### Tab between Source/Target

- **Tab** cycles between the Source and Target cell on the same row.
- **Ctrl+Tab** inserts a literal tab character inside the text.

## Pagination

If your project is large, you can enable pagination and move page-by-page.

- See: [Pagination](pagination.md)

## Tips

- Keep one hand on the keyboard for speed: navigate, edit, confirm, repeat.
- If you work in a CAT tool daily, customize shortcuts to match your muscle memory.
