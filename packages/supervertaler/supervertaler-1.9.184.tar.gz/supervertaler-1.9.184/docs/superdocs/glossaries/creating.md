# Creating Glossaries

Glossaries (termbases) help you enforce terminology consistently.

## Create a glossary

1. Open **Project resources → Glossaries**
2. Click **Create Glossary**
3. Give it a name and select languages

## Add terms while translating

You can build terminology as you work:

- Select text in both Source and Target
- Use **Add to Glossary** from the context menu

## Tips

- Use a separate glossary per client when terminology differs.
- Add high-priority terms first (product names, UI strings).
