# Fuzzy Matching

Fuzzy matching finds similar segments (not just exact duplicates).

## How to use it

- As you navigate, Supervertaler searches your TMs for similar source text.
- Matches are scored by similarity.

## When to trust a match

- **High scores** are often safe to insert as a starting point.
- **Mid/low scores** can still be useful, but should be treated as suggestions.

## Tips

- Always review fuzzy matches before inserting.
- For formatted text, preserve tags when inserting matches.
