# Unified Prompt Library - User Guide

## 🎉 What's New

Supervertaler's prompt system has been simplified from a confusing 4-layer architecture to an intuitive 2-layer system:

### Old System (Confusing!)
- ❌ System Prompts tab
- ❌ Domain Prompts tab  
- ❌ Project Prompts tab
- ❌ Style Guides tab
- 🤯 Too many layers, hard to understand

### New System (Simple!)
- ✅ **System Prompts** (in Settings - you rarely touch these)
- ✅ **Prompt Library** (your main workspace - one unified view)

---

## 📚 The Prompt Library

- Add prompts to your Quick Run menu

## 🔧 System Prompts (Advanced)

### What Are They?

Technical prompts that handle CAT tool tag preservation and basic translation setup. They're automatically selected based on what you're doing:

- **Single Segment** - When translating selected text
- **Batch DOCX** - When processing Word documents
- **Batch Bilingual** - When importing CAT tool bilingual files

### Where Are They?

Settings > Translation > System Prompts

⚠️ **Warning:** Only modify these if you understand CAT tool formats. These handle the technical stuff (memoQ tags, Trados tags, etc.).

## 🔄 Migration

### What Happened?

When you first opened the new version:

1. ✅ Old folders backed up with `.old` extension
2. ✅ All prompts migrated to new Library/ folder
3. ✅ Metadata added (favorites, quick-run, etc.)
4. ✅ JSON prompts converted to Markdown
5. ✅ System Prompts moved to Settings

### Your Old Files

- **Backed up** in same location with `.old` extension
- **Not deleted** - safe to remove once you verify everything works
- Located in: `user_data/Prompt_Library/*.old`

### Rollback

If something went wrong (unlikely), you can manually:

1. Delete `user_data/Prompt_Library/Library/`
2. Rename `.old` folders back to original names
3. Restart application

## 🤔 FAQ

### Q: Where did my prompts go?

**A:** They're in `Prompt Library/Library/`. The tree view shows them organized by folder.

### Q: Can I still use my old prompts?

**A:** Yes! They were automatically migrated. Check the new folder structure.

### Q: What if I liked the old 4-layer system?

**A:** The new system does the same thing, just more intuitively. Your primary prompt replaces "Domain Prompt," attached prompts replace "Project Prompts" and "Style Guides."

### Q: How do I edit System Prompts?

**A:** Settings > Translation > System Prompts. But be careful - these handle CAT tool tags.

### Q: Can I organize prompts differently?

**A:** Absolutely! Create any folder structure you want. The built-in folders are just suggestions.

### Q: What's the difference between Primary and Attached?

**A:** 
- **Primary** = Your main translation instructions (domain expertise, task type)
- **Attached** = Additional rules that modify the primary (style guides, formatting, tone)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Prompts not showing up

1. Click "🔄 Refresh" button

3. Check file permissions

### Migration failed

- Check logs in terminal
- Backup files should exist as `.old`

### Can't find old prompts

- Look in `user_data/Prompt_Library/*.old` folders
- These are your backups
- Copy any missing files to `Library/` manually

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### Organization

- **Style Guides folder:** Language-specific formatting rules
- **Domain Expertise folder:** Industry/domain knowledge
- **Active Projects folder:** Client-specific instructions
- Create project subfolders: `Active Projects/ClientName/ProjectCode/`

### Favorites

- Mark 3-5 most-used prompts as favorites
- Faster than browsing folders
- Perfect for your "go-to" domain prompts

### Multi-Attach Strategy

```
Primary: Domain expertise (Medical, Legal, etc.)
Attach: Language style guide (Dutch, English UK, etc.)
Attach: Project-specific rules (if any)
Attach: Tone/formatting preferences

= Comprehensive combined prompt
```

### Naming

- Use descriptive names: "Medical Device IFU Translation"
- Not: "Prompt 1", "Test", "New"
- Include language if relevant: "Dutch Style Guide"

### Tags

Add tags to prompts for better organization:
