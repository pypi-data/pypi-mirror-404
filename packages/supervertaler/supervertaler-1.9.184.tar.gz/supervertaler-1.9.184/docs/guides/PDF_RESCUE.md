## 📖 Overview

**PDF Rescue** is a specialised AI-powered OCR tool designed to extract clean, editable text from poorly formatted PDFs. Built into Supervertaler v3.5.0-beta, it uses GPT-4 Vision to intelligently recognise text, formatting, redactions, stamps, and signatures—producing professional, translator-ready documents.

### 🎯 The Problem It Solves

Have you ever received a PDF translation job where:
- The text won't copy-paste cleanly?
- Line breaks are all over the place?
- Formatting is completely broken?
- Traditional OCR produces gibberish?
- Redacted sections show as black boxes?
- Stamps and signatures clutter the text?

**PDF Rescue fixes all of this.**

###  Real-World Success Story

> *"I had a client reach out for a rush job—a 4-page legal document that had clearly been scanned badly. Traditional OCR couldn't handle it, and manual retyping would have taken hours.*
> 
> *I used PDF Rescue's one-click PDF import, processed all 4 pages with AI OCR, and it produced a flawless Word document that I could immediately start working with. What would have been a multi-day nightmare became a straightforward job I could deliver on time.*
> 
> *I was able to tell my client that I could handle the job—and delivered professional quality. PDF Rescue literally saved a client relationship."*

## 🎨 Smart Features Explained

### Redaction Handling

PDF Rescue intelligently detects redacted/blacked-out text and inserts descriptive placeholders **in the document's language**:

**Example (Dutch document)**:
```
Source PDF: "De heer ████████ heeft op ██████ een bedrag van €████ betaald."

PDF Rescue Output: "De heer [naam] heeft op [datum] een bedrag van €[bedrag] betaald."
```

**Example (English document)**:
```
Source PDF: "Mr. ████████ paid $████ on ██████."

PDF Rescue Output: "Mr. [name] paid $[amount] on [date]."
```

**How it works**:
- AI detects language automatically
- Contextually determines what's redacted (name, date, amount, etc.)
- Inserts appropriate placeholder in square brackets
- No manual language specification needed!

---

### Stamp & Signature Detection

Non-text elements are described in square brackets:

**Dutch**:
- `[stempel]` - Stamp/seal
- `[handtekening]` - Signature
- `[logo]` - Company logo

**English**:
- `[stamp]` - Official stamp
- `[signature]` - Handwritten signature
- `[seal]` - Official seal

**Benefit**: Translators know where non-text elements belong without seeing the original.

---

### Formatting Preservation

When **"Preserve formatting"** is checked:

**Input (as seen by AI)**:
```
This document contains **important legal terms** that must be followed.
Payment is due *within 30 days* of invoice date.
The __deadline is strict__.
```

**DOCX Export**:
- "**important legal terms**" → **important legal terms** (bold)
- "*within 30 days*" → *within 30 days* (italic)
- "__deadline is strict__" → <u>deadline is strict</u> (underlined)

**Preview Shows Markdown** (temporary):
- Preview pane displays `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `__underline__`
- Final DOCX has proper formatting (no visible markers)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Always use PDF import** - Eliminates manual screenshot/conversion steps
2. **Leave formatting enabled** - Better output quality, easily disabled if needed
3. **Review first page** - Process one page first to check quality before batch
4. **Save session report** - Professional documentation for clients/records
5. **Keep images** - Stored next to PDF for future reference

### Quality Optimization

**For best OCR results**:
- ✅ Use high-quality source PDFs when possible
- ✅ gpt-4o model recommended (best accuracy)
- ✅ Process similar pages in batches (consistent instructions)
- ✅ Review extracted text before delivering
- ✅ Customize instructions for specialized documents (if needed)

**If results aren't perfect**:
- Try different model (gpt-4-turbo vs gpt-4o)
- Disable formatting if causing issues
- Adjust instructions (advanced users)
- Process problematic pages individually
- Use "Show Prompt" to understand AI behavior

### Cost Management

**API Usage**:
- Each image = 1 API call
- Cost depends on model:
  - `gpt-4o` - Most expensive, best quality
  - `gpt-4o-mini` - Budget option, ~90% quality
  - `gpt-4-turbo` - Middle ground

**Optimization**:
- ✅ Process only selected pages if partial document
- ✅ Use gpt-4o-mini for drafts/testing
- ✅ Review one page before processing all (catch issues early)
- ✅ Skip already-processed pages (automatic)
