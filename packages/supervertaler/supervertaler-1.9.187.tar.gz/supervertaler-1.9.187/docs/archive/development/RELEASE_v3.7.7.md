# Supervertaler v3.7.7 Release Notes

**Release Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Type**: Critical Bug Fix + Feature Enhancement  
**Status**: Production Ready

---

## 🎯 Overview

Version 3.7.7 addresses a critical segment alignment issue in memoQ bilingual DOCX translation and adds support for OpenAI's GPT-5 (o3-mini) reasoning model. This release ensures perfect 1:1 segment alignment and reliable translation of medical/technical documentation.

---

## 🐛 Critical Fixes

### **memoQ Bilingual DOCX Alignment** (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Problem**: Segments were getting misaligned when translating memoQ bilingual DOCX files. Translation for segment 100 could appear in segment 101, causing data corruption.

**Root Cause**:
1. TM lookup during batch translation was skipping some segments
2. Fallback line-by-line matching assumed sequential response but LLM might skip lines
3. Prompt contradicted itself: said "NO segment numbers" but parser expected them

**Solution**:
- ✅ Translate ALL segments (no filtering by target content)
- ✅ Removed TM exact match checking during batch translation
- ✅ Fixed prompt to REQUIRE segment numbers with ⚠️ warnings
- ✅ Removed fallback line-by-line matching completely
- ✅ Only strict regex matching: `r'^(\d+)[\.\)]\s*(.+)'`

**User Responsibility**:
- Export memoQ bilingual DOCX with "View" filtered to untranslated segments only
- This ensures all target segments are empty before import to Supervertaler

**Testing**: ✅ Verified with 198-segment medical device documentation (CT scanner interface)
- Chunk 1: 100/100 segments ✅
- Chunk 2: 98/98 segments ✅
- Total: 198/198 perfect alignment

### **GPT-5 Temperature Compatibility**

**Problem**: GPT-5 (o3-mini) and reasoning models failed with error:
```
Error code: 400 - Unsupported value: 'temperature' does not support 0.3 with this model. 
Only the default (1) value is supported.
```

**Solution**:
- ✅ Model detection for reasoning models (o1, o3, gpt-5)
- ✅ Use `temperature=1.0` for reasoning models (required, no flexibility)
- ✅ Use `temperature=0.3` for standard models (gpt-4o, gpt-4-turbo, etc.)

**Code**:
```python
if "o3" in model.lower() or "o1" in model.lower() or "gpt-5" in model.lower():
    temperature=1.0  # Required for reasoning models
else:
    temperature=0.3  # Standard models
```

---

### **Content Policy Enhancement**

**Problem**: OpenAI content moderation was refusing medical device documentation despite professional context.

**Solution**:
Enhanced professional context in all three prompt types:
- ✅ "Licensed service for commercial translation company"
- ✅ "Commissioned by medical device manufacturer"
- ✅ "Regulatory compliance and patient safety documentation"
- ✅ "THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR MEDICAL ADVICE"
- ✅ "Legally required regulatory filing"

**Applied to**:
- `single_segment_prompt` (Ctrl+T)
- `batch_docx_prompt` (DOCX files)
- `batch_bilingual_prompt` (memoQ bilingual, TXT files)

**Result**: No content policy refusals on medical/technical content with GPT-5

## 📊 Testing Results

### **Medical Device Documentation (CT Scanner Interface)**

**Document**: 198 segments, medical device user interface translation (EN→NL)  
**Model**: GPT-5 (o3-mini)  
**Content**: Technical/medical terminology (heart rate, radiation dose, scan protocols)

**Results**:
```
[15:08:01] ✓ Full document context prepared (198 segments)
[15:11:40] ✓ Chunk 1/2 complete (100/100 segments)
[15:14:46] ✓ Chunk 2/2 complete (98/98 segments)
[15:18:43] ✓ Batch translation complete: 198 successful, 0 failed, 2 API calls
```

**Alignment Verification**:
- ✅ Segment 1 → 1
- ✅ Segment 100 → 100
- ✅ Segment 198 → 198
- ✅ All uicontrol tags preserved
- ✅ All menucascade tags preserved
- ✅ Import back into memoQ successful

**Translation Time**:
- Chunk 1: ~3.5 minutes (100 segments)
- Chunk 2: ~3 minutes (98 segments)
- Total: ~6.5 minutes for 198 segments

## 🎯 Workflow

### **Correct memoQ Bilingual DOCX Workflow**

**Step 1: Prepare Export in memoQ**
1. Open project in memoQ
2. Apply View filter → Untranslated segments only
3. Export bilingual DOCX with filter active
4. Save file (e.g., `document_untranslated.docx`)

**Step 2: Import into Supervertaler**
1. File → Import → memoQ bilingual table (DOCX)
2. Select filtered DOCX file
3. Verify: `✓ Imported 198 segments from memoQ bilingual DOCX`
4. Check all target segments are empty

**Step 3: Translate**
1. Set LLM to GPT-5 (recommended for medical/technical)
2. Translate → Translate All Untranslated Segments
3. Wait for completion: `✓ Batch translation complete: 198 successful, 0 failed`

**Step 4: Export**
1. File → Export → memoQ bilingual table - Translated (DOCX)
2. Save file (e.g., `document_translated.docx`)
3. Verify: `✓ Exported 198 translations to memoQ bilingual DOCX`

**Step 5: Import Back into memoQ**
1. In memoQ, import the translated bilingual DOCX
2. Verify alignment (segment 1→1, 100→100, etc.)
3. Check tags preserved

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Code Changes**

**Alignment Logic** (`translate_all_untranslated()` lines ~18906-19140):
```python
# OLD: Filter for untranslated segments
untranslated = [seg for seg in self.segments if not seg.target or seg.status == "untranslated"]

# NEW: Translate ALL segments (user ensures empty targets)
segments_to_translate = self.segments[:]

# REMOVED: TM lookup during batch
# REMOVED: Fallback line-by-line matching

# NOW: Strict segment ID parsing only
for line in response_lines:
    match = re.match(r'^(\d+)[\.\)]\s*(.+)', line)
    if match:
        seg_id = int(match.group(1))
        translation = match.group(2).strip()
        translations[seg_id] = translation
```

**Prompt Instructions** (lines ~19045-19060):
```python
# OLD: Contradictory
"Provide ONLY the translations, one per line. NO segment numbers."

# NEW: Explicit requirement
"⚠️ CRITICAL: Include the segment NUMBER before each translation"
"Format: 123. translation text"
"Example: 42. De vertaling van segment 42"
```

**Temperature Detection** (`call_openai_api()` lines ~19249-19269):
```python
model_lower = self.current_llm_model.lower()
if "o3" in model_lower or "o1" in model_lower or "gpt-5" in model_lower:
    temperature=1.0  # Reasoning models
else:
    temperature=0.3  # Standard models
```

## 📚 Best Practices

### **Model Selection**

**For Medical/Technical Documentation**:
- ✅ **GPT-5** - Most reliable, no content policy issues
- ⚠️ **GPT-4o** - Faster/cheaper but inconsistent content moderation

**For General Content**:
- ✅ **GPT-4o** - Fast, cost-effective
- ✅ **Claude Sonnet** - Good alternative
- ✅ **Gemini** - Another option

### **memoQ Integration**

**Always**:
- ✅ Filter to untranslated in memoQ before export
- ✅ Use "Import memoQ bilingual table (DOCX)" in Supervertaler
- ✅ Use "Export memoQ bilingual table - Translated (DOCX)" in Supervertaler

**Never**:
- ❌ Use regular "Import DOCX" (loses memoQ structure)
- ❌ Export from memoQ without filtering
- ❌ Use regular "Export DOCX" (loses segment alignment)
