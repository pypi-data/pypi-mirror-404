# Term Extraction

Term extraction helps you build a glossary from your project’s source text.

## Typical workflow

1. Import your project
2. Run term extraction
3. Review suggested terms
4. Add the important ones to your glossary

{% hint style="info" %}
Term extraction is a great first step for technical documents (product names, UI labels, recurring domain terms).
{% endhint %}

## Tips

- Term extraction works best on domain-specific documents.
- Always review suggestions before adding them.
