# Supervertaler Qt Migration Plan
## From tkinter v3.7.x to PyQt6 v1.x

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** Active Development

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the complete migration plan for Supervertaler from tkinter (v3.7.x) to PyQt6 (v1.x). This is a **long-term quality investment** to create a professional-grade CAT tool with industry-standard UI/UX.

### Why Qt?

The Qt demo (`qt_grid_demo.py`) proved that Qt offers:

✅ **Perfect auto-sizing** - One line: `table.resizeRowsToContents()`  
✅ **Sharp, crisp fonts** - Native rendering at all sizes  
✅ **Zero wasted space** - Professional grid layout like memoQ  
✅ **Industry standard** - Used by commercial CAT tools  
✅ **Superior widgets** - Better components than tkinter can offer  

**User verdict:** "ok, this is MUCH better"

## Versioning Strategy

### Dual-Track Development

We will maintain **two separate programs** during migration:

#### **Supervertaler_v3.7.x.py** (tkinter - Maintenance Mode)
- **Purpose:** Stable production version
- **Changes:** Bug fixes only, no new features
- **Versioning:** Continue 3.7.x numbering (3.7.7, 3.7.8, etc.)
- **Timeline:** Maintained until Qt version reaches feature parity
- **Status:** Current working version with all features

#### **Supervertaler_Qt_v1.x.py** (PyQt6 - Active Development)
- **Purpose:** Future production version
- **Changes:** New features, progressive migration
- **Versioning:** Start from v1.0.0, increment as features are added
- **Timeline:** Progressive development, no rush
- **Status:** Clean slate, professional foundation

### Version Numbering

**Qt Version Format:** `Supervertaler_Qt_v1.MINOR.PATCH.py`

- **v1.0.0** - Phase 1: Core infrastructure
- **v1.1.0** - Phase 2: Project management
- **v1.2.0** - Phase 3: File import/export
- **v1.3.0** - Phase 4: Translation Memory
- **v1.4.0** - Phase 5: Advanced features
- **v2.0.0** - Full feature parity + new Qt-exclusive features

## Feature Comparison Matrix

| Feature | tkinter v3.7.x | Qt v1.0.0 | Qt v2.0.0 (Planned) |
|---------|---------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Grid Display** | ⚠️ Acceptable | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Perfect |
| **Auto-sizing** | ⚠️ Approximation | ✅ Perfect | ✅ Perfect |
| **Font Rendering** | ⚠️ Fuzzy | ✅ Sharp | ✅ Sharp |
| **Speed (1000 segments)** | ⚠️ Slow | ✅ Fast | ✅ Blazing |
| **Memory Usage** | ⚠️ High | ✅ Lower | ✅ Optimized |
| **UI Customization** | ❌ Limited | ✅ Good | ✅ Extensive |
| **Native Look** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

## Code Reuse Strategy

### What Stays the Same (70% of codebase)

**Business Logic Modules** (no changes needed):
- ✅ `modules/translation_memory.py` - TM engine
- ✅ `modules/docx_handler.py` - DOCX processing
- ✅ `modules/mqxliff_handler.py` - XLIFF processing
- ✅ `modules/tmx_generator.py` - TMX generation
- ✅ `modules/prompt_assistant.py` - AI logic
- ✅ `modules/config_manager.py` - Configuration
- ✅ Data models (`Segment`, `Project` classes)

**What Changes:** Only the UI calls these modules instead of tkinter

### What Needs Rewriting (30% of codebase)

**UI Layer Only:**
- tkinter widgets → PyQt6 widgets
- Grid/List/Document views → Qt equivalents
- Dialogs → Qt dialogs
- Event handlers → Qt signals/slots

**No logic duplication** - Just new UI connecting to same modules

---

## Development Workflow

### Recommended Approach

1. **Start with Qt v1.0.0** (already done! ✅)
2. **Test with real projects** - Load your actual translation projects
3. **Identify next priority feature** - What do you miss most from tkinter?
4. **Migrate that feature** - Implement in Qt
5. **Increment version** - v1.0.0 → v1.1.0 → v1.2.0...
6. **Repeat** until feature parity
7. **Add Qt-exclusive features** for v2.0.0

### No Rush Philosophy

> "I don't mind working on this for a very long time. I just want the app to eventually be as good as it possibly can be."

**This means:**
- ✅ Quality over speed
- ✅ One feature at a time
- ✅ Test thoroughly before moving on
- ✅ Keep tkinter version as fallback
- ✅ No pressure, no deadlines
- ✅ Enjoy the process

## Risk Mitigation

### Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Time investment** | 🟡 Medium | No deadline, work at your pace |
| **Learning Qt** | 🟢 Low | Similar to tkinter, good docs |
| **Missing tkinter features** | 🟢 Low | Keep tkinter v3.7.x as fallback |
| **Project file compatibility** | 🟢 Low | Same JSON format |
| **User confusion** | 🟢 Low | Clear naming (v3.7.x vs Qt v1.x) |
| **Module integration** | 🟢 Low | Modules already decoupled |

**Overall Risk:** 🟢 **LOW** - Very safe migration path

---

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success (v1.0.0) ✅
- ✅ Qt app runs and loads projects
- ✅ Grid displays with perfect auto-sizing
- ✅ Fonts are sharp and crisp
- ✅ Can edit and save translations
- ✅ User prefers Qt grid over tkinter

**Status:** ✅ **ACHIEVED** - "ok, this is MUCH better"

### Phase 2 Success (v1.1-1.2)
- Can create new projects from scratch
- All import formats work (DOCX, MQXLIFF)
- All export formats work (DOCX, TMX, Excel)
- Recent projects fully functional

### Final Success (v2.0.0)
- All tkinter features migrated
- Qt performs better in every way
- Users prefer Qt version exclusively
- tkinter version deprecated

---

## Effort Estimation

### Total Development Time

**Conservative Estimate:**
- Phase 1: ✅ 1 day (complete)
- Phase 2: 1 week
- Phase 3: 1 week
- Phase 4: 2 weeks
- Phase 5: 2 weeks
- Phase 6: 3 weeks

**Total: 8-10 weeks full-time**

**But since you're working at your own pace:**
- **Part-time (2-3 hours/day):** 4-6 months
- **Weekend project:** 6-12 months
- **Whenever you feel like it:** 1-2 years

**And that's perfectly fine!** The tkinter version works meanwhile.

## Conclusion

This migration is:

✅ **Technically sound** - Qt is proven better  
✅ **Low risk** - Keep tkinter as fallback  
✅ **Incremental** - One feature at a time  
✅ **High reward** - Professional-grade final product  
✅ **Your pace** - No deadlines, no pressure  

**You're not rewriting everything** - Just the UI layer (30% of code)  
**You're building something better** - Industry-standard CAT tool  
**You have time** - No rush, quality first  

The Qt v1.0.0 foundation is **solid**. Every feature you add from here makes it more powerful. By the time you reach v2.0.0, you'll have a CAT tool that rivals commercial products.

**Welcome to the Qt journey!** 🚀
