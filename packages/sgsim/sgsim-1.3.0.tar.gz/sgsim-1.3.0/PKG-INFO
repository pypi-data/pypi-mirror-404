**SGSIM** is a Python package that provides two main capabilities:  
> 1. **Simulation** of earthquake ground motions using a site-compatible stochastic method [[1]](#references).  
> 2. **Processing and analysis** of ground motions, including filtering, trimming, and calculating various intensity measures (e.g., PGA, SA, FAS, etc.).
