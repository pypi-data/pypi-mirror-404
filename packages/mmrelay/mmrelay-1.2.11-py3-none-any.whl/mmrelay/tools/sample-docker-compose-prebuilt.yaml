    # Optional: Watchtower for automatic updates (Recommended)
    # Uncomment to check for updates daily at 2 AM
    # Uses label-based filtering to update only labeled containers
    # Note: Uses Watchtower fork https://github.com/nicholas-fedor/watchtower (maintained, fixes Docker API issues)

  # Uncomment below to enable automatic updates:
