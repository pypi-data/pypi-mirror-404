    Periodically verify the Meshtastic connection and trigger a reconnect when the device appears unresponsive.

    Checks run until the module-level `shutting_down` flag is True. Behavior:
    - Controlled by config["meshtastic"]["health_check"]:
      - `enabled` (bool, default True) — enable or disable checks.
      - `heartbeat_interval` (int, seconds, default 60) — interval between checks. For backward compatibility, a top-level `heartbeat_interval` under `config["meshtastic"]` is supported.
    - BLE connections are excluded from periodic checks because BLE libraries provide real-time disconnect detection.
    - For non-BLE connections, attempts a metadata probe (via _get_device_metadata) and, if parsing fails, a fallback probe using `client.getMyNodeInfo()`. If both probes fail and no reconnection is already in progress, calls on_lost_meshtastic_connection(...) to initiate reconnection.

    No return value; side effects are logging and scheduling/triggering reconnection when the device is unresponsive.
