def run_main(args: Any) -> int:
    """
    Start the application: load configuration, validate required keys, and run the main async runner.

    Loads and applies configuration (optionally overriding logging level from args), initializes module configuration, verifies required configuration sections (required keys are ["meshtastic", "matrix_rooms"] when credentials.json is present, otherwise ["matrix", "meshtastic", "matrix_rooms"]), and executes the main async entrypoint. Returns process exit codes: 0 for successful completion or user interrupt, 1 for configuration errors or unhandled exceptions.

    Parameters:
        args: Parsed command-line arguments (may be None). Recognized option used here: `log_level` to override the configured logging level.

    Returns:
        int: Exit code (0 on success or user-initiated interrupt, 1 on failure such as invalid config or runtime error).
