      OWL_2_EL:
        description: OWL 2 EL (Existential Language) - optimized for applications using very large ontologies with basic
          relationships. Provides polynomial time reasoning.

        annotations:
          complexity: polynomial time
          use_case: large biomedical ontologies, SNOMED CT
      OWL_2_QL:
        description: OWL 2 QL (Query Language) - optimized for query answering over large data repositories. Based on 
          DL-Lite family.

        - https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-profiles/#OWL_2_QL
        annotations:
          complexity: LogSpace data complexity
          use_case: ontology-based data access, database integration
      OWL_2_RL:
        description: OWL 2 RL (Rule Language) - optimized for rule-based reasoning and can be implemented using rule 
          engines. Compatible with RDF Schema.

        - https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-profiles/#OWL_2_RL
        annotations:
          complexity: polynomial time
          use_case: business rules, policy systems
      OWL_2_DL:
        description: OWL 2 DL (Description Logic) - full expressiveness while maintaining computational completeness and
          decidability. Maximum expressiveness without sacrificing decidability.
        title: OWL 2 DL
        see_also:
        - https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/
        annotations:
          complexity: NExpTime
          use_case: general purpose ontologies requiring high expressiveness
      OWL_2_FULL:
        description: OWL 2 Full - maximum expressiveness with no restrictions, but reasoning is undecidable. Allows full
          RDF capabilities.
        title: OWL 2 Full
        see_also:
        - https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/
        annotations:
          complexity: undecidable
          use_case: maximum flexibility, no guaranteed reasoning
