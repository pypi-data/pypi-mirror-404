  Staging systems for neuroblastoma including the International Neuroblastoma
  Risk Group Staging System (INRGSS) and International Neuroblastoma Staging
  System (INSS). INRGSS is the current standard (effective 2024+) based on
  imaging and image-defined risk factors. INSS is the legacy surgical staging
  system still used for historical data.

    description: >-
      International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Staging System (INRGSS) stages.
      A clinical staging system based on imaging and image-defined risk factors
      (IDRFs), effective for diagnosis years 2024+. Allows staging before any
      treatment, unlike the surgical INSS system.
