    description: >-
      Gene Ontology evidence codes used to describe the type of support for GO annotations.
      Each code maps to the Evidence and Conclusion Ontology (ECO). Evidence codes are
      categorized by whether they represent experimental evidence, computational analysis,
      phylogenetic inference, author statements, or electronic annotation. All codes except
      IEA represent manual curation.
