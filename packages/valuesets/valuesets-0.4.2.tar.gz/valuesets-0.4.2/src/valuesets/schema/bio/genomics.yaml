  CdsPhaseType:
    title: Cds Phase Type
    description: For features of type CDS (coding sequence), the phase indicates where the feature begins with reference
      to the reading frame. The phase is one of the integers 0, 1, or 2, indicating the number of bases that should be 
      removed from the beginning of this feature to reach the first base of the next codon.
