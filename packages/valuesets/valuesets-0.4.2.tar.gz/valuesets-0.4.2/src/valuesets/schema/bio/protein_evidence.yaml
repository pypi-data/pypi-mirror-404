    permissible_values:
      EXPERIMENTAL_EVIDENCE_AT_PROTEIN_LEVEL:
        description: Indicates that there is clear experimental evidence for the existence of the protein. The criteria 
          include partial or complete Edman sequencing, clear identification by mass spectrometry, X-ray or NMR 
          structure, good quality protein-protein interaction or detection of the protein by antibodies.
      EXPERIMENTAL_EVIDENCE_AT_TRANSCRIPT_LEVEL:
        description: Indicates that the existence of a protein has not been strictly proven but that expression data 
          (such as existence of cDNA(s), RT-PCR or Northern blots) indicate the existence of a transcript.
      PROTEIN_INFERRED_BY_HOMOLOGY:
        description: Indicates that the existence of a protein is probable because clear orthologs exist in closely 
          related species.
      PROTEIN_PREDICTED:
        description: Used for entries without evidence at protein, transcript, or homology levels.
      PROTEIN_UNCERTAIN:
        description: Indicates that the existence of the protein is unsure.

      MODEL:
        description: The RefSeq record is provided by the NCBI Genome Annotation pipeline and is not subject to 
          individual review or revision between annotation runs.
      INFERRED:
        description: The RefSeq record has been predicted by genome sequence analysis, but it is not yet supported by 
          experimental evidence. The record may be partially supported by homology data.
      PREDICTED:
        description: The RefSeq record has not yet been subject to individual review, and some aspect of the RefSeq 
          record is predicted.
      PROVISIONAL:
        description: The RefSeq record has not yet been subject to individual review. The initial sequence-to-gene 
          association has been established by outside collaborators or NCBI staff.
      REVIEWED:
        description: The RefSeq record has been reviewed by NCBI staff or by a collaborator. The NCBI review process 
          includes assessing available sequence data and the literature. Some RefSeq records may incorporate expanded 
          sequence and annotation information.
      VALIDATED:
        description: The RefSeq record has undergone an initial review to provide the preferred sequence standard. The 
          record has not yet been subject to final review at which time additional functional information may be 
          provided.
      WGS:
        description: The RefSeq record is provided to represent a collection of whole genome shotgun sequences. These 
          records are not subject to individual review or revisions between genome updates.
