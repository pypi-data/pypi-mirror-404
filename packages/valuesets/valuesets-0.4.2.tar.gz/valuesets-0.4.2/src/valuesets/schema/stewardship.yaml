title: Value Set Stewardship Organizations
description: |
  Organizations and consortia that steward value sets and terminologies.

  This enum is used with the `stewards`, `publishers`, and `endorsers` slots
  defined in the valuesets_meta metamodel to track organizational responsibility
  for value set content.

  ## Identifier Guidelines

  - **ROR IDs** (https://ror.org/) are preferred for formal organizations
  - For consortia without ROR IDs, use canonical website URLs
  - All identifiers should be stable, persistent URIs
