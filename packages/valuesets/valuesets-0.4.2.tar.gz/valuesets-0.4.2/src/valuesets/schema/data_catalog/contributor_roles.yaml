title: DataCite Contributor Types
description: |
  Contributor type classifications from DataCite 4.6.

  This enum is separate from CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy) which
  focuses on research contribution activities. DataCite contributor types
  describe organizational and functional roles in resource creation and
  management.

  For research contribution activities, see ResearchRole in academic/research.yaml
  which uses CRediT terms.
