# Evaluation Methods

This directory contains evaluation methods, metrics, and assessment tools for GAIK solutions.

## Purpose

The evaluation methods layer provides:

- **Performance Metrics**: Quantitative measures for assessing GenAI solution quality, accuracy, and efficiency
- **Evaluation Scripts**: Automated evaluation workflows for generic use cases
- **LLM-as-Judge**: Evaluation approaches where language models assess output quality
- **Test Cases & Ground Truth**: Reference data and input-output pairs for validation
- **Benchmarking**: Tools for comparing different approaches or configurations

## Structure

Evaluation methods are organized by:

- **Generic Use Case**: Each generic use case may have associated evaluation methods
- **Knowledge Process**: Evaluations specific to extraction, capture, or generation processes
- **Metric Type**: Accuracy, latency, cost, user satisfaction, etc.

## Usage

Evaluation methods are used to:

1. **Validate Solutions**: Ensure generic use cases produce expected results
2. **Compare Approaches**: Benchmark different software components or configurations
3. **Monitor Performance**: Track solution quality over time in production
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Identify areas for enhancement through systematic assessment
