# FT8 Decoding and Encoding in Python with CLI and research code
This repository contains Python code to decode and encode (all the way to audio) FT8, plus a minimal Command Line Interface for reception, and a nascent set of research code.

## Motivation
This started out as me thinking "How hard can it be, really?" after some frustration with Windows moving sound devices around and wanting to get a minimal decoder running that I can fully control.

My current aim is to push the low SNR performance whilst using only one time/frequency grid and no time-domain processing. 

Code I'd like to highlight, all in 100% Python:
* [LDPC using just three 5~8 line functions](https://github.com/G1OJS/PyFT8/blob/main/PyFT8/ldpc.py) and running 250 us per iteration on a Dell Optiplex
* [Ordered Statistics Decoding](https://github.com/G1OJS/PyFT8/blob/main/PyFT8/osd.py) in about 60 lines of code & similarly fast (not measured yet)

## Uses
I use this code for my own hobby-level reseearch into FT8 decoding and Python coding techniques, and I'm also building a browser-GUI station controller (image below) which has an FT8 transceiver integrated within it. You can see that [here](https://github.com/G1OJS/station-gui) but note that it's focussed on my station, i.e. ICOM-IC-7100 with an Arduino controlling antenna switching and magloop tuning.

## Performance
On a quiet band with good signals, PyFT-8 typically gets 70% or 80% and often 100% of WSJT-x decodes. On a crowded band, PyFT8 performs less well. WSJT-x uses signal subtraction to improve performance with overlapping signals. PyFT8 can decode overlapping signals surprisingly well, but not as well as WSJT-x. The three plots below, showing WSJT-x and PyFT8 decodes as a function of the standard deviation of the llr (a good proxy for signal decodability) show how the quieter band has fewer overlaps and allows PyFT8 a larger percentage of decodes.

I use the wav file "210703_133430.wav" (third plot above) as a reference. In NORM mode, WSJT-x gets 19 decodes. WSJT-x in FAST mode gets 14 decodes, PyFT8 gets 12, and FT8_lib gets 8. The specific decodes are shown in the table below.

## Installation
This repository is usually a little ahead of the releases I send to PyPI, but you can pip install it from there and just use the Command Line Interface (which can also transmit individual messages) if you want to.

<img width="981" height="511" alt="cmd" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3df103a-0a43-4da6-a3b1-8825012f07b0" />


Install using:
```
pip install PyFT8
```

And to run, use the following (more info [here](https://github.com/G1OJS/PyFT8/blob/main/docs/cli.md))
```
PyFT8_cli "Keyword1, Keyword2" [-c][-v]
```
<sub> * where keywords identify the sound device - partial match is fine - and -c = concise, -v = verbose</sub>

Otherwise, please download or browse the code, or fork the repo and play with it! If you do fork it, please check back here as I'm constantly (as of Jan 2026) rewriting and improving.

## Limitations
In pursuit of tight code, I've concentrated on core standard messages, leaving out some of the less-used features. The receive part of the
code doesn't (yet) have the full capability of the advanced decoders used in WSJT-x, and so gets only about 60% of the decodes that WSJT-x gets, depending on band conditions (on a quiet band with only good signals PyFT8 will get close to 100%).

## Acknowledgements
This project implements a decoder for the FT8 digital mode.
FT8 was developed by Joe Taylor, K1JT, Steve Franke, K9AN, and others as part of the WSJT-X project.
Protocol details are based on information publicly described by the WSJT-X authors and in related open documentation.

Some constants and tables (e.g. Costas synchronization sequence, LDPC structure, message packing scheme) are derived from 
the publicly available WSJT-X source code and FT8 protocol descriptions. Original WSJT-X source is © the WSJT Development Group

Also thanks to [Robert Morris](https://github.com/rtmrtmrtmrtm) for [basicft8(*1)](https://github.com/rtmrtmrtmrtm/basicft8) - the first code I properly read when I was wondering whether to start this journey. (*1 note: applies to FT8 pre V2)
