# Domains

Domains describe the geometry and coordinate systems for PDE problems. They are used to
sample points, build product structures, and define functions with explicit coordinate
labels.

For a guide to components and sampling modes (paired vs coord-separable), see
[Guides → Domains and sampling](../../guides_domain.md).
