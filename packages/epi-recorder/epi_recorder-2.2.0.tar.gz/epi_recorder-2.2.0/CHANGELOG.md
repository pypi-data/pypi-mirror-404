- **`epi debug` command**: Automatic mistake detection (loops, hallucinations, inefficiencies)
- **Async API support**: `record_async()` context manager for async workflows

### Technical
- Migrated from global context to `contextvars.ContextVar` for thread isolation

### Changed
- Updated `patch_all()` to include Gemini alongside OpenAI
- Added 'gemini' to package keywords

### Fixed
- **Windows Compatibility**: Replaced Unicode emojis in CLI output with ASCII to prevent crashes on legacy terminals
- **Error Handling**: Improved API error reporting (e.g., Quota Exceeded) with user-friendly UI panels

## [2.1.2] - 2026-01-17

## [2.1.1] - 2025-12-16

### Added
