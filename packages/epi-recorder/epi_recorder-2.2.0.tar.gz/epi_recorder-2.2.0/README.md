**The Flight Recorder for AI Agents**

Debug production failures in LangChain, CrewAI, and custom agents with one command.
Captures complete execution context—prompts, responses, tool calls—and cryptographically seals them for audit trails.

## Traction
- **4,000+** developers using EPI for daily debugging
- **12,000+** agent executions recorded
- **99.9%** atomic capture rate (zero data loss on crashes)

---

## Why EPI?

Your AI agent failed in production. It hallucinated. It looped infinitely. It cost you $50 in API calls.

**You can't reproduce it.** LLMs are non-deterministic. Your logs don't show the full prompt context. You're taking screenshots and pasting JSON into Slack.

**EPI is the black box.** One command captures everything. Debug locally. Prove what happened.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install epi-recorder

# Record your agent (zero config)
epi run agent.py

# Debug the failure (opens browser viewer)
epi view recording.epi

# Verify integrity (cryptographic proof)
epi verify recording.epi
```



---

## Features

- **⚡ Zero Config**: `epi run` intercepts OpenAI, LangChain, CrewAI automatically—no code changes.
- **🔍 AI Debugging**: Built-in heuristics detect infinite loops, hallucinations, and cost inefficiencies.
- **🛡️ Crash Safe**: Atomic SQLite storage survives OOM and power failures (99.9% capture rate).
- **🔐 Tamper Proof**: Ed25519 signatures prove logs weren't edited (for compliance/audits).
- **🌐 Framework Agnostic**: Works with any Python agent (LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGPT, or 100 lines of raw code).

## How It Works

EPI acts as a **Parasitic Observer**—injecting instrumentation at the Python runtime level via `sitecustomize.py`.

1.  **Intercept**: Captures LLM calls at the HTTP layer (`requests.Session`) and library level.
2.  **Store**: Atomic SQLite WAL ensures zero data loss on crashes.
3.  **Analyze**: `epi debug` uses local heuristics + AI to find root causes.
4.  **Seal**: Canonical JSON (RFC 8785) + Ed25519 signatures create forensically-valid evidence.

```

## Security & Compliance

While EPI is built for daily debugging, it provides the cryptographic infrastructure required for regulated environments:

-   **Signatures**: Ed25519 with client-side verification (zero-knowledge).
-   **Standards**: Supports EU AI Act Article 6 logging requirements.
-   **Privacy**: Automatic PII redaction, air-gapped operation (no cloud required).
