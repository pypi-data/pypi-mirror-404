"""Tax-loss harvesting (TLH) logic for portfolio optimization.

Tax-loss harvesting identifies opportunities to sell securities at a loss to offset
capital gains and reduce tax liability. This module provides:
- Automatic detection of unrealized loss positions
- Wash sale rule compliance (IRS 30-day rule)
- Replacement security suggestions for maintaining market exposure
- Tax savings calculations based on current tax rates

Key Concepts:
- **Unrealized Loss**: Position where current price < cost basis
- **Wash Sale**: Buying "substantially identical" security 30 days before/after sale
- **Replacement Security**: Similar exposure without triggering wash sale
- **Tax Savings**: Loss amount × tax rate (offset against gains)

IRS Rules:
- Wash sale window: 30 days before + 30 days after sale (61-day total)
- Disallowed loss if wash sale occurs (loss deferred to new position basis)
- "Substantially identical": Same company stock, options, similar securities
- Replacement suggestions must have different exposure (e.g., sector ETF vs individual stock)

Example:
    >>> from fin_infra.tax.tlh import find_tlh_opportunities
    >>> from fin_infra.brokerage import easy_brokerage
    >>>
    >>> broker = easy_brokerage(mode="paper")
    >>> positions = broker.positions()
    >>>
    >>> # Find TLH opportunities (min $100 loss)
    >>> opportunities = find_tlh_opportunities(
    ...     user_id="user123",
    ...     positions=positions,
    ...     min_loss=100.0
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> for opp in opportunities:
    ...     print(f"{opp.position.symbol}: ${opp.loss_amount} loss")
    ...     print(f"  Replace with: {opp.replacement_ticker}")
    ...     print(f"  Tax savings: ${opp.potential_tax_savings} @ {opp.tax_rate}%")
    ...     print(f"  Wash sale risk: {opp.wash_sale_risk}")

Production Notes:
- Use svc-infra jobs to run daily TLH scans (cron: "0 9 * * 1-5" for weekday mornings)
- Cache results with 24h TTL (market prices change daily)
- Integrate with brokerage API for recent trades (wash sale checking)
- Use ai-infra LLM for intelligent replacement suggestions (sector analysis, correlation)
- Add compliance logging for all TLH recommendations (audit trail)
- Consider state tax rates in addition to federal (varies by state)

Cost Considerations:
- Market data: Use fin_infra.markets for current prices (~$0.01/quote)
- LLM suggestions: Use ai-infra LLM for replacements (~$0.001/suggestion)
- Target: <$0.05/user/month for TLH analysis
