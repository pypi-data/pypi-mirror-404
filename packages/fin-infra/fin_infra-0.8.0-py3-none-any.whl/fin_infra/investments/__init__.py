"""Investment holdings and portfolio data integration.

This module provides READ-ONLY access to investment holdings, securities,
and portfolio data from aggregation providers (Plaid, SnapTrade).

Enables real P/L calculations, asset allocation analysis, and portfolio tracking.
Serves personal finance apps, robo-advisors, wealth management platforms.

Supported Providers:
- Plaid Investment API: 15,000+ institutions (401k, IRA, traditional accounts)
- SnapTrade: 125M+ retail accounts, 70+ brokerages (real-time, hybrid read+write)

Example usage:
    from fin_infra.investments import easy_investments

    # Zero config (uses env vars)
    investments = easy_investments()

    # Explicit provider
    investments = easy_investments(provider="plaid")
    holdings = await investments.get_holdings(access_token)

    # Calculate metrics
    allocation = investments.calculate_allocation(holdings)
    metrics = investments.calculate_portfolio_metrics(holdings)

    # With FastAPI
    from svc_infra.api.fastapi.ease import easy_service_app
    from fin_infra.investments import add_investments

    app = easy_service_app(name="FinanceAPI")
    investments = add_investments(app, provider="plaid")

Environment Variables:
    Plaid:
        PLAID_CLIENT_ID: Client ID from Plaid dashboard
        PLAID_SECRET: Secret key from Plaid dashboard
        PLAID_ENVIRONMENT: "sandbox", "development", or "production" (default: sandbox)

    SnapTrade:
        SNAPTRADE_CLIENT_ID: Client ID from SnapTrade dashboard
        SNAPTRADE_CONSUMER_KEY: Consumer key from SnapTrade dashboard
        SNAPTRADE_ENVIRONMENT: "sandbox" or "production" (default: sandbox)
