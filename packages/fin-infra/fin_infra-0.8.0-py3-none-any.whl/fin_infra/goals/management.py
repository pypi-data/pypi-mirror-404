"""
LLM-validated financial goal tracking with progress monitoring (Section 17 V2).

Provides 4 goal types with validation and progress tracking:
1. Retirement Goal: Calculate required savings for target age/amount
2. Home Purchase Goal: Validate down payment timeline
3. Debt-Free Goal: Debt payoff schedule with APR calculations
4. Wealth Milestone: Project growth to target net worth

Uses ai-infra LLM for validation + local math for calculations.
Weekly progress check-ins via svc-infra.jobs scheduler ($0.0036/user/month).

Example:
    from ai_infra.llm import LLM
    from fin_infra.goals.management import FinancialGoalTracker

    llm = LLM()
    tracker = FinancialGoalTracker(
        llm=llm,
