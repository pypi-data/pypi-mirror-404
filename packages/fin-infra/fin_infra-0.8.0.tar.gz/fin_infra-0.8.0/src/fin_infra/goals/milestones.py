Milestone tracking for financial goals.

Provides milestone management with:
- Add/update milestones to goals
- Automatic milestone detection and celebration
- Webhook notifications when milestones reached
- Progress tracking with milestone history

Example:
    from fin_infra.goals.milestones import add_milestone, check_milestones
    from datetime import datetime

    # Add milestone
    milestone = add_milestone(
        goal_id="goal_123",
        amount=25000.0,
        target_date=datetime(2026, 6, 1),
        description="25% to emergency fund target"
    )

    # Check which milestones have been reached
    reached = check_milestones("goal_123")
    for m in reached:
        print(f" Milestone reached: {m['description']}")
