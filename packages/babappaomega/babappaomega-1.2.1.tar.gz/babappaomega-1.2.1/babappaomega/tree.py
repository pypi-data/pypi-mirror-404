def load_tree(tree_path):
    """
    Load a phylogenetic tree from Newick format.

    Notes
    -----
    - Uses ete3 for tree parsing.
    - Explicitly checks for the 'six' dependency, which ete3
      requires at runtime but does not declare strictly.
    - Imported lazily to keep CLI startup lightweight.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tree_path : str or Path
        Path to Newick-formatted tree file.

    Returns
    -------
    ete3.Tree
        Parsed phylogenetic tree.

def enumerate_branches(tree):
    """
    Enumerate non-root branches in a stable, reproducible order.

    Branch naming rules
    -------------------
    - Terminal branches use leaf names.
    - Internal branches get deterministic names based on traversal order.
    - Root is excluded by design.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tree : ete3.Tree
        Parsed phylogenetic tree.

    Returns
    -------
    list of str
        Stable list of branch identifiers.
