# SignalFlow

**SignalFlow** is a high-performance Python framework for algorithmic trading, designed to manage the full strategy lifecycle from signal detection to execution. It bridges the gap between research and production by providing a robust pipeline for signal generation, meta-labeling validation, and automated trading.

## Core Architecture: The Signal Pipeline

The framework implements a modular three-stage processing logic:

1. **🕵️ Signal Detector**: Scans market data (OHLCV or tick) to identify potential market events. Detectors can range from simple SMA crossovers to complex deep learning models.

2. **⚖️ Signal Validator (Meta-Labeling)**: Based on Lopez de Prado's methodology, this stage assesses the quality and risk of detected signals using classification models (e.g., LightGBM, XGBoost).

3. **♟️ Trading Strategy**: Converts validated signals into actionable trade positions, managing entry, exit, and risk.


## Key Features

* **Polars-First Performance**: Core data processing utilizes `polars` for extreme efficiency with large datasets.

* **Production Ready**: Code written for research and backtesting is designed for direct deployment to live trading.

* **Advanced Labeling**: Native support for Triple-Barrier Method and Fixed-Horizon labeling for ML training.


* **Kedro Integration**: Fully compatible with Kedro for reproducible R&D and automated data pipelines.

* **Flexible Extensibility**: Easily add custom features via the `@sf_component` registry.


## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install signalflow-trading

```

### Signal Detection Example

```python
from signalflow.core import RawDataView
from signalflow.detector import SmaCrossSignalDetector

# Initialize a detector (SMA 20/50 crossover)
detector = SmaCrossSignalDetector(fast_period=20, slow_period=50)

# Run detection on a data snapshot
signals = detector.run(raw_data_view)

```

### Signal Validation (Meta-Labeling)

```python
from signalflow.validator import SklearnSignalValidator

# Create a validator using LightGBM
validator = SklearnSignalValidator(model_type="lightgbm")

# Fit the model on labeled historical signals
validator.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Validate new signals to get success probabilities
validated_signals = validator.validate_signals(signals, features)

```

## Tech Stack

* **Data**: `polars`, `pandas`, `duckdb`.
