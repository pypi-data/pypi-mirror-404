# Installation

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or higher
- pip or uv package manager (uv recommended for faster installs)

## Install from PyPI

=== "uv (Recommended)"

    ```bash
    uv pip install strapi-kit
    ```

=== "pip"

    ```bash
    pip install strapi-kit
    ```

**Why uv?** It's 10-100x faster than pip while being a drop-in replacement.

## Install with Development Dependencies

    ```bash
    uv pip install strapi-kit[dev]
    ```

=== "pip"

    ```bash
    pip install strapi-kit[dev]
    ```

This includes:
- pytest and testing tools
- mypy for type checking
- ruff for linting
- code coverage tools

    git clone https://github.com/mehdizare/strapi-kit.git
