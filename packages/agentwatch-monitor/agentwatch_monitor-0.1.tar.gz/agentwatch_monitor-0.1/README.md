## What is AgentWatch?

AgentWatch monitors AI agents (Claude Code, Moltbot, Cursor, Aider) for:

- **Health Issues**: Loops, thrashing, context rot, error spirals
- **Security Threats**: Credential theft, prompt injection, data exfiltration
- **Operational Efficiency**: Token burn rate, context pressure, cache utilization

Think of it as a fitness tracker for your AI agent, plus a security guard.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install agentwatch

# Health check
agentwatch check

# Security scan
agentwatch security-scan

# Real-time monitoring TUI
agentwatch watch --security

# Monitor all running agents
agentwatch watch-all
```

## Scoring System

AgentWatch produces three independent scores that blend into one overall health score.

### Overall Health Score

The overall score is a weighted blend of three components:

| Component | Weight | What it measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| **Detectors** | 40% | Behavioral warnings from pattern detectors |
| **Efficiency** | 30% | Operational resource usage (tokens, cache, pacing) |
| **Context Health** | 30% | Session rot (repetition, thrashing, stalling) |

Weights are configurable via `HealthWeights(detectors=0.4, efficiency=0.3, rot=0.3)`.

### Status States

All three scoring systems share a unified 4-state status:

| Status | Score Range | Meaning |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Healthy** | 80 - 100 | Everything is operating normally |
| **Degraded** | 60 - 79 | Performance declining, monitor closely |
| **Warning** | 40 - 59 | Significant issues, consider acting |
| **Critical** | 0 - 39 | Immediate action needed |

### Detector Categories

Detectors produce warnings with severity levels that deduct from a per-category score (starting at 100):

| Severity | Score Impact |
|----------|-------------|
| LOW | -5 |
| MEDIUM | -15 |
| HIGH | -30 |
| CRITICAL | -50 |

Health detector categories and their weights in the detector score:

| Category | Weight | What it covers |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Progress** | 35% | Loops, stalls, thrashing |
| **Errors** | 30% | Error spirals, repeated failures |
| **Context** | 20% | Context rot, rediscovery, pressure |
| **Goal** | 15% | Goal drift, wasted effort |

### Efficiency Score

Pure operational resource metrics, independent of behavioral signals. Sub-metrics grouped into three penalty categories:

| Category | Sub-metrics | What it tracks |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Pressure** | Context pressure (30%), burn rate (20%), I/O ratio (10%) | How fast the session is consuming its token budget |
| **Cache** | Cache hit rate (15%) | How effectively the session reuses cached context |
| **Pacing** | Duration (15%), actions per turn (10%) | How long the session has been running and tool call density |

Context pressure uses cumulative throughput against a 2M token session budget. This is monotonically increasing and survives auto-compaction and tool restarts.

Cost (estimated from token counts) is displayed as informational only and does not affect the score.

### Context Health (Rot Detection)

Deterministic rot detection tracks five metric families:

| Metric | What it detects |
|--------|----------------|
| **Behavioral** | Output length inflation, hedge word density |
| **Repetition** | Repeated sentences, self-repeating n-grams |
| **Tool Thrash** | Repeated commands, error loops, stalls |
| **Progress** | Edit deficit, file churn |
| **Constraints** | Violated project constraints (forbidden paths, required files) |

The rot score uses EMA smoothing and a state machine that requires sustained degradation before escalating status.

## Health Detectors

| Detector | What It Catches |
|----------|-----------------|
| `loop` | Agent repeating the same action |
| `thrash` | Edit-test-fail cycles |
| `reread` | Re-reading files excessively |
| `stall` | Lots of reading, no writing |
| `error_spiral` | Consecutive failures |
| `error_blindness` | Same error repeated without fix |
| `context_rot` | Early important files forgotten |
| `context_pressure` | Context window filling up |

## Security Detectors

| Detector | What It Catches |
|----------|-----------------|
| `credential_access` | Reading ~/.aws, ~/.ssh, .env files |
| `secret_in_output` | API keys, tokens in output |
| `prompt_injection` | "Ignore previous instructions" attacks |
| `hidden_instruction` | Zero-width chars, encoded commands |
| `privilege_escalation` | sudo, chmod +s, etc. |
| `dangerous_command` | rm -rf /, fork bombs |
| `network_anomaly` | Connections to pastebin, webhook.site |
| `data_exfiltration` | File reads followed by network |
| `malicious_skill` | Skills accessing credentials |

Security categories and weights:

| Category | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| Injection | 25% |
| Credential | 20% |
| Exfiltration | 20% |
| Privilege | 15% |
| Network | 10% |
| Supply Chain | 10% |

A single CRITICAL severity security warning immediately sets the security score to 0.

## Supported Agents

Use in CI/CD:

```bash
agentwatch check --json || echo "Agent health issues detected"
agentwatch security-scan || echo "Security issues detected"
```

## Configuration

```python
from agentwatch import create_registry, ActionBuffer, parse_file
from agentwatch.health import HealthWeights, calculate_health, calculate_efficiency

# Create custom registry
registry = create_registry(mode="all")  # "health", "security", or "all"

# Parse logs
buffer = ActionBuffer()
for action in parse_file(Path("session.jsonl")):
    buffer.add(action)

# Run checks
warnings = registry.check_all(buffer)

# Calculate scores with custom weights
eff = calculate_efficiency(warnings, buffer)
report = calculate_health(
    warnings,
    efficiency_score=eff.score,
    rot_score=0.2,
    weights=HealthWeights(detectors=0.5, efficiency=0.25, rot=0.25),
)

print(f"Overall: {report.overall_score}% ({report.status})")
```

### Custom Detectors

```python
from agentwatch import Detector, Category, Severity, Warning, ActionBuffer

class MyDetector(Detector):
    category = Category.PROGRESS
    name = "my_detector"
    description = "Detects my custom pattern"

    def check(self, buffer: ActionBuffer) -> Warning | None:
        if some_condition:
            return Warning(
                category=self.category,
                severity=Severity.HIGH,
                signal="my_signal",
                message="Something bad detected",
            )
        return None

registry.add_detector(MyDetector())
```

## Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TIER 1: Deterministic Detectors (always on)            │
│  - Pattern matching, regex, thresholds                  │
│  - Zero cost, zero latency, auditable                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                          │
                          v (optional, on suspicious activity)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TIER 2: LLM Analysis (opt-in)                          │
│  - Semantic analysis of ambiguous cases                 │
│  - Local model (Ollama) or cheap API (Haiku)            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

All built-in detectors are deterministic (Tier 1) for:
- **Auditability**: Can explain exactly why alerts fired
- **Speed**: Real-time detection
- **Cost**: No API calls
- **No meta-injection**: Can't fool a regex

## Multi-Agent Monitoring

`agentwatch watch-all` auto-discovers running agents via process scanning and monitors them on a unified dashboard. Each agent gets its own isolated scoring pipeline. Agent identification uses `lsof` to resolve the exact log file each process has open, preventing cross-contamination when multiple agents work on the same project.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! Especially:

- New detectors for failure patterns you've observed
