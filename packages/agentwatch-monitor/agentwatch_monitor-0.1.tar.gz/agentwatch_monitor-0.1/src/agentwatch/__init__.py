"""AgentWatch - Health and security monitoring for AI agents.

AgentWatch monitors AI coding agents (Claude Code, Moltbot, Cursor, etc.)
for behavioral issues and security threats in real-time.

Quick Start:
    # Health check
    agentwatch check

    # Security scan
    agentwatch security-scan

    # Real-time monitoring
    agentwatch watch --security

Features:
    - Health monitoring: loops, thrashing, context rot, error spirals
    - Security monitoring: credential access, prompt injection, exfiltration
    - Support for multiple agents: Claude Code, Moltbot, Cursor
    - TUI dashboard for real-time monitoring
    - JSON output for CI/CD integration
