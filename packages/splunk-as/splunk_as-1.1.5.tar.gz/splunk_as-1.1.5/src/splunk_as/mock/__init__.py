Mock Splunk Client Module

Provides mixin-based mock clients for testing Splunk skills without
a live Splunk instance. Uses a composable mixin architecture to
allow selective testing of different API areas.

Example usage:
    # Full mock client with all mixins
    from splunk_as.mock import MockSplunkClient

    client = MockSplunkClient()
    result = client.oneshot_search("index=main | head 10")

    # Check if mock mode is enabled via environment variable
    from splunk_as.mock import is_mock_mode

    if is_mock_mode():
        client = MockSplunkClient()
    else:
        client = SplunkClient(...)

    # Skill-specific minimal clients
    from splunk_as.mock import MockSearchClient, MockJobClient

    search_client = MockSearchClient()  # Only search functionality
    job_client = MockJobClient()        # Only job lifecycle

    # Custom mock with specific mixins
    from splunk_as.mock.base import MockSplunkClientBase
    from splunk_as.mock.mixins import SearchMixin, JobMixin

    class CustomMock(SearchMixin, JobMixin, MockSplunkClientBase):
        pass

    client = CustomMock()

    # Use factories for consistent response structures
    from splunk_as.mock.factories import (
        ResponseFactory,
        JobFactory,
        ResultFactory,
    )

    client.set_response("/some/endpoint", ResponseFactory.paginated(items))
