    Generates Confiture migrations from pgGit history.

    This class analyzes pgGit branches and commits, then produces
    migration files that can be applied via Confiture to any

    1. Developer makes schema changes on pgGit-enabled dev database

    3. MigrationGenerator creates migration files from those commits
    4. Migrations are deployed to production via `confiture migrate up`
