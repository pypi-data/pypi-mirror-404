"""Compliance automation and reporting.

Provides compliance reporting for 7 major regulations:
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation - EU)
- CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act - USA)
- PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act - Canada)
- LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados - Brazil)
- PIPL (Personal Information Protection Law - China)
- Privacy Act (Australia)
- POPIA (Protection of Personal Information Act - South Africa)

Features:
- Regulation-specific requirement tracking
- Compliance matrix across all regulations
- Automated audit trail generation
- Data lineage integration
- Breach notification support
- Data subject rights automation (access, deletion, portability)

Example:
    >>> from confiture.core.anonymization.compliance import (
    ...     ComplianceReportGenerator, Regulation
    ... )
    >>> from confiture.core.anonymization.security.lineage import DataLineageTracker

    ...     time_period=("2024-01-01", "2024-12-31")
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> print(f"GDPR Compliance: {report.coverage_percentage(Regulation.GDPR):.1f}%")
    >>> print(f"Recommendations: {len(report.recommendations)}")
