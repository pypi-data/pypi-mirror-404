"""Confiture Migration Testing Framework.

Comprehensive testing framework for PostgreSQL migrations including:
- Migration loader utility for easy test setup
- Test fixtures (SchemaSnapshotter, DataValidator, MigrationRunner)
- Mutation testing (27 mutations across 4 categories)
- Performance profiling with regression detection
- Load testing with 100k+ row validation
- Advanced scenario testing

Example:
    >>> from confiture.testing import load_migration, SchemaSnapshotter, DataValidator
    >>> Migration003 = load_migration("003_move_catalog_tables")
    >>> # or by version:
    >>> Migration003 = load_migration(version="003")
