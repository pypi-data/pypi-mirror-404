## Available Examples

### 1. Basic Migration

**Location**: [`01-basic-migration/`](./01-basic-migration/)

**Perfect for**: Learning Confiture fundamentals

**Strategies**: Medium 1 (Build from DDL) + Medium 2 (Incremental Migrations)

A simple blog application with users, posts, and comments. Learn the core workflow of building schemas and applying migrations.

**What you'll learn**:
- ✅ Project initialization with `confiture init`
- ✅ Schema organization (numbered directories)
- ✅ Building complete schema from DDL files (<1 second)
- ✅ Detecting schema changes with `confiture migrate diff`
- ✅ Generating and applying migrations
- ✅ Rolling back migrations safely
- ✅ Testing migrations locally

**Database**: 3 tables (users, posts, comments)

**Key commands**:
```bash
confiture init
confiture build --env local
confiture migrate diff old.sql new.sql --generate --name add_bio
confiture migrate up
confiture migrate down
```

### 2. FraiseQL Integration

**Location**: [`02-fraiseql-integration/`](./02-fraiseql-integration/)

**Perfect for**: GraphQL-first development teams

**Strategies**: GraphQL schema → PostgreSQL migrations

Integrate Confiture with FraiseQL to automatically generate database migrations from GraphQL schema changes. Build a task management API with type-safe queries.

**What you'll learn**:
- ✅ GraphQL type → PostgreSQL table mapping
- ✅ Automatic migration generation from schema changes
- ✅ Type-safe database queries via FraiseQL
- ✅ Full-stack GraphQL application setup
- ✅ Keeping GraphQL and database schemas in sync

**Database**: 4 tables (users, projects, tasks, task_assignments)

**Key concepts**:
- GraphQL types automatically generate migrations
- Single source of truth (GraphQL schema)
- Type safety from frontend to database

[→ Go to FraiseQL Example](./02-fraiseql-integration/README.md)

---

### 3. Zero-Downtime Migration

**Location**: [`03-zero-downtime-migration/`](./03-zero-downtime-migration/)

**Perfect for**: Production database migrations with zero downtime

**Strategies**: Medium 4 (Schema-to-Schema via Foreign Data Wrappers)

Migrate a production e-commerce database from old to new schema with zero downtime using PostgreSQL Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW). Includes complete migration scripts and rollback procedures.

**What you'll learn**:
- ✅ Setting up Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW)
- ✅ Dual-write pattern for zero-downtime
- ✅ Incremental data migration with progress tracking
- ✅ Blue-green deployment strategy
- ✅ Safe rollback procedures
- ✅ Production-ready migration orchestration

**Database**:
- Old schema: 5 tables (legacy structure)
- New schema: 6 tables (normalized, performant)

**Key scripts**:
- `01_setup_fdw.sql` - Configure Foreign Data Wrappers
- `02_dual_write.sql` - Enable writes to both schemas
- `03_migrate_data.sql` - Incremental data migration
- `04_cutover.sql` - Final cutover to new schema
- `05_cleanup.sql` - Remove old schema

### 4. Production Sync & Anonymization

**Location**: [`04-production-sync-anonymization/`](./04-production-sync-anonymization/)

**Perfect for**: Syncing production data to staging/local with PII protection

**Strategies**: Medium 3 (Production Data Sync)

Copy production database to staging or local environments with automatic PII anonymization. Compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations.

**What you'll learn**:
- ✅ Secure production database dumps with `pg_dump`
- ✅ Automatic PII detection and anonymization
- ✅ Custom anonymization rules per column
- ✅ Preserving referential integrity
- ✅ Anonymization strategies (masking, hashing, replacement)
- ✅ Compliance with data protection regulations

**PII Handling**:
- Email addresses → `user_N@example.com`
- Names → `User N`, `Anonymous N`
- Phone numbers → Randomized
- Credit cards → `****-****-****-1234` (last 4 digits)
- SSN → `***-**-NNNN` (masked)
- IP addresses → Anonymized

**Key commands**:
```bash
confiture sync production local --anonymize
confiture sync production staging --anonymize --columns emails,names,phones
```

[→ Go to Production Sync Example](./04-production-sync-anonymization/README.md)

### 5. Multi-Environment Workflow

**Location**: [`05-multi-environment-workflow/`](./05-multi-environment-workflow/)

**Perfect for**: Teams with CI/CD pipelines and multiple environments

**Strategies**: All four mediums orchestrated across environments

Complete CI/CD workflow with automated testing, staging deployment, and production migration. Includes GitHub Actions, Docker, and rollback procedures.

**What you'll learn**:
- ✅ Multi-environment configuration (local, test, staging, production)
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- ✅ Automated testing of migrations
- ✅ Staging deployment with anonymized data
- ✅ Production deployment with safety checks
- ✅ Rollback and disaster recovery
- ✅ Docker and Docker Compose setup

**Environments**:
- **Local**: Developer machines (fast iteration)
- **Test**: CI/CD automated tests
- **Staging**: Pre-production testing with production-like data
- **Production**: Live customer database

**CI/CD Pipeline**:
1. Developer pushes to branch → Tests run automatically
2. Merge to `main` → Deploy to staging
3. Manual approval → Deploy to production
4. Automatic rollback on failure

**Key files**:
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Automated testing
- `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml` - Staging deployment
- `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` - Production deployment
- `docker-compose.yml` - Local multi-environment setup

### 6. Multi-Agent Coordination (NEW!)

**Location**: [`multi-agent-workflow/`](./multi-agent-workflow/)

**Perfect for**: Teams or AI agents working in parallel on schema changes

**Strategies**: Multi-agent coordination with conflict detection

Enable safe parallel schema development with automatic conflict detection. Learn how multiple agents (human developers or AI) can work on database schemas simultaneously without conflicts.

**What you'll learn**:
- ✅ Setting up coordination database
- ✅ Registering intentions before making changes
- ✅ Automatic conflict detection (table, column, timing overlaps)
- ✅ Status tracking and audit trail
- ✅ Completing and abandoning work
- ✅ JSON output for CI/CD integration
- ✅ Dashboard integration patterns

**Scenarios covered**:
- **Scenario 1**: Parallel feature development (2 agents, different tables) ✅ No conflict
- **Scenario 2**: Conflicting changes (2 agents, same table) ⚠️ Conflict detected
- **Scenario 3**: Timing conflicts (overlapping work periods) 📅 Warning issued

**Key commands**:
```bash
# Initialize coordination
confiture coordinate init --db-url postgresql://localhost/confiture_coord

# Register intention
confiture coordinate register \
    --agent-id alice \
    --feature-name user_profiles \
    --tables-affected users

# Check for conflicts
confiture coordinate check \
    --agent-id bob \
    --tables-affected users

# View status
confiture coordinate status --format json

# Complete work
confiture coordinate complete --intent-id int_abc123
```

**Perfect for**:
- Teams with multiple developers working on schema
- AI-assisted schema development (multiple AI agents)
- CI/CD pipelines with automated conflict detection
- Audit trail requirements (who changed what, when)
