"""Data subject rights automation.

Provides automated fulfillment of data subject rights required by modern
data protection regulations. These include access, erasure, portability,
and rectification rights.

Supported Rights:
- Right to Access: Get all data held about a person
- Right to Erasure: Delete all data about a person (GDPR "right to be forgotten")
- Right to Rectification: Correct inaccurate data
- Right to Portability: Get data in portable format
- Right to Restrict Processing: Limit how data is used
- Right to Object: Oppose processing for certain purposes

Regulations:
- GDPR: Articles 15-21 (EU)
- CCPA: Sections 1798.100, 1798.105, 1798.110 (USA)
- LGPD: Articles 18-23 (Brazil)
- Other modern regulations

Example:
    >>> from confiture.core.anonymization.data_subject_rights import (
    ...     DataSubjectRightsManager, RequestType
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> manager = DataSubjectRightsManager(conn, storage_path)
    >>>
    >>> # Process access request
    >>> request = manager.create_request(
    ...     request_type=RequestType.ACCESS,
    ...     data_subject_id="user@example.com",
    ...     contact_email="user@example.com",
    ...     reason="Subject access request"
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> # Verify identity and fulfill request
    >>> data = manager.fulfill_access_request(request)
    >>> data_path = manager.export_to_portable_format(data)
    >>> manager.send_to_subject(request, data_path)
    >>>
    >>> # Process deletion request
    >>> del_request = manager.create_request(
    ...     request_type=RequestType.ERASURE,
    ...     data_subject_id="user@example.com"
