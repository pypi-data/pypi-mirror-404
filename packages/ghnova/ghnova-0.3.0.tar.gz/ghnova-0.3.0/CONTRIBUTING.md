# Contributing to ghnova

🎉 Thank you for your interest in contributing to `ghnova`!
Your ideas, fixes, and improvements are welcome and appreciated.

Whether you’re fixing a typo, reporting a bug, suggesting a feature,
or submitting a pull request—this guide will help you get started.

## How to Contribute

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

1. Open an Issue

    - Have a question, bug report, or feature suggestion?
    [Open an issue](https://github.com/isaac-cf-wong/ghnova/issues/new/choose)
    and describe your idea clearly.
    - Check for existing issues before opening a new one.

2. Fork and Clone the Repository

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:<username>/ghnova.git
    cd ghnova
    ```

3. Set Up Your Environment

    We recommend using uv to manage virtual environments for installing `ghnova`.
    If you don't have uv installed, you can install it with pip. See the project pages for more details:

    - Install via pip: `pip install --upgrade pip && pip install uv`
    - Project pages: [uv on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/uv/) | [uv on GitHub](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
    - Full documentation and usage guide: [uv docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

    ```shell
    # Create a virtual environment (recommended with uv)
    uv venv --python 3.10
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -e ".[dev]"
    ```

4. Set Up Pre-commit Hooks and Commitlint

    We use **pre-commit** to ensure code quality and consistency,
    and **commitlint** to enforce commit message conventions.
    After installing dependencies, run:

    ```shell
    pre-commit install
    pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
    ```

    This ensures checks like code formatting, linting, and basic hygiene run automatically when you commit.

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

    The project includes a `commitlint.config.js` configuration file that defines the commit message rules.
    Once installed, commitlint will automatically validate your commit messages when pre-commit runs.

    !!!important
        Commit messages are validated in CI/CD pipelines, and the changelog is auto-generated from commits.
        See section [Commit Message Guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines) below for details.

5. Create a New Branch

    Give it a meaningful name like fix-typo-in-docs or feature-add-summary-option.

6. Make Changes

    - Write clear, concise, and well-documented code.
    - Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style conventions.
    - Add or update unit tests when applicable.
    - **Keep changes atomic and focused**: one type of change per commit
      (e.g., do not mix refactoring with feature addition).

7. Run Tests

    Ensure that all tests pass before opening a pull request:

    ```shell
    pytest
    ```

8. Open a Pull Request

    Clearly describe the motivation and scope of your change. Link it to the relevant issue if applicable.
    The pull request titles should match the [Conventional Commits spec](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

## Commit Message Guidelines

**Why this matters:** Our changelog is automatically generated from commit messages using git-cliff.
Commit messages must follow the Conventional Commits format and adhere to strict rules.

### Rules

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

1. **One type of change per commit**

    - Do not mix different types of changes (e.g., bug fixes, features, refactoring) in a single commit.
    - Example: if you refactor code AND add a feature, make two separate commits.

2. **Descriptive and meaningful messages**

    - Describe _what_ changed and _why_, not just _what_ was edited.
    - Avoid vague messages like "fix bug" or "update code";
      instead use "fix: prevent signal saturation in noise simulation" or "feat: add support for multi-detector frame merging".

3. **Follow Conventional Commits format**

    - All commit messages must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard.
    - Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
    - Allowed types:
        - build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
        - ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
        - docs: Documentation only changes
        - feat: A new feature
        - fix: A bug fix
        - perf: A code change that improves performance
        - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
        - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
        - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
    - Example:

        ```text
        feat(signal): add BBH waveform generation for aligned-spin systems

        This commit introduces support for aligned-spin binary black hole
        waveforms using PyCBC, enabling more realistic simulations.
        ```

    - Commitlint will validate your message format automatically.

### Examples

✅ **Good commits:**

```text
feat(parser): add support for YAML configuration files
fix(logger): prevent crash on empty log messages
docs(readme): update installation instructions for clarity
refactor(utils): simplify data processing pipeline
```

❌ **Bad commits:**

```text
fixed stuff
wip: many changes
update code
more fixes (no type/scope)
```

## 💡 Tips

- Be kind and constructive in your communication.
- Keep PRs focused and atomic—smaller changes are easier to review.
- Document new features and update existing docs if needed.
- Tag your PR with relevant labels if you can.
