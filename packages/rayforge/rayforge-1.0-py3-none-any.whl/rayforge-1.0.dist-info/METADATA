## Key Features

| Feature                      | Description                                                                                                      |
| :--------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Modern UI**                | Polished and modern UI built with Gtk4 and Libadwaita. Supports system, light, and dark themes.                  |
| **Parametric Sketch Editor** | Create precise, constraint-based 2D designs with geometric and dimensional constraints.                          |
| **Multi-Layer Operations**   | Assign different operations (e.g., engrave then cut) to layers in your design.                                   |
| **Versatile Operations**     | Supports Contour, Raster Engraving (with cross-hatch fill), Shrink Wrap, and Depth Engraving.                    |
| **Overscan & Kerf Comp.**    | Improve engraving quality with overscan and ensure dimensional accuracy with kerf compensation.                  |
| **2.5D Cutting**             | Perform multi-pass cuts with a configurable step-down between each pass for thick materials.                     |
| **3D G-code Preview**        | Visualize G-code toolpaths in 3D to verify the job before sending it to the machine.                             |
| **Multi-Machine Profiles**   | Configure and instantly switch between multiple machine profiles.                                                |
| **GRBL Firmware Settings**   | Read and write firmware parameters (`$$`) directly from the UI.                                                  |
| **Comprehensive 2D Canvas**  | Full suite of tools: alignment, transformation, measurement, zoom, pan, and more.                                |
| **Advanced Path Generation** | High-quality image tracing, travel time optimization, path smoothing, and spot size interpolation.               |
| **Holding Tabs**             | Add tabs to contour cuts to hold pieces in place. Supports manual and automatic placement.                       |
| **G-code Macros & Hooks**    | Run custom G-code snippets before/after jobs. Supports variable substitution.                                    |
| **Broad File Support**       | Import from SVG, DXF, PDF, JPEG, PNG, BMP, and even Ruida files (`.rd`).                                         |
| **Multi-Laser Operations**   | Choose different lasers for each operation in a job                                                              |
| **Camera Integration**       | Use a USB camera for workpiece alignment, positioning, and background tracing.                                   |
| **Cross-Platform**           | Native builds for Linux and Windows.                                                                             |
| **Extensible**               | Open development model makes it easy to [add support for new devices](website/content/docs/developer/driver.md). |
| **Multi-Language**           | Available in English, Portuguese, Spanish, German, French, and Chinese.                                          |
| **G-code Dialects**          | Supports GRBL, Smoothieware, and other GRBL-compatible firmwares.                                                |
