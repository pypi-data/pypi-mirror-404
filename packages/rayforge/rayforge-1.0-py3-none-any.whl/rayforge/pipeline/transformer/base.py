    The pipeline runner does not execute transformers in their simple list
    order; it groups them by phase and runs them sequentially. This ensures
    a logical flow where path continuity is preserved for transformers that
    need it.

    The execution order is always:
    1. GEOMETRY_REFINEMENT: For transformers that modify path geometry but
       require it to be continuous (e.g., Smooth).
    2. PATH_INTERRUPTION: For transformers that intentionally create gaps or
       discontinuities in paths (e.g., TabOpsTransformer).
    3. POST_PROCESSING: For transformers that operate on the final, potentially
       segmented paths (e.g., Optimize, MultiPass).
