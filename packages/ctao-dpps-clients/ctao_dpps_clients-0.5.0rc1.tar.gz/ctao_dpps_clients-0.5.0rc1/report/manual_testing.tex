The configuration of RSEs was tested in a pre-production setup at PIC.
Three RSEs were configured in BMS:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A dCache-based RSE at PIC
  \item A dCache-based RSE at CSCS
  \item a GridFTP-based RSE in the current CTAO North Site data center
\end{itemize}

Transfers were successfully made between the Onsite RSE and the PIC RSE using the GridFTP protocol
and between PIC and CSCS using the root protocol.
