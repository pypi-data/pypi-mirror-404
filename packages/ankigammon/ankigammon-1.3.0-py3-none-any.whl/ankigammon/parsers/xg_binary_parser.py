        Convert CubeEntry to Decision object.

        XG binary files contain cube entries for all cube decisions in a game,
        but not all of them are analyzed. This method filters out unanalyzed
        cube decisions and extracts equity values from analyzed ones.

        Unanalyzed cube decisions are identified by:
        - FlagDouble == -100 or -1000 (indicates not analyzed)
        - All equities are 0.0 and position is empty

        Analyzed cube decisions contain:
        - equB: Equity for "No Double"
        - equDouble: Equity for "Double/Take"
        - equDrop: Equity for "Double/Pass" (typically -1.0 for opponent)
        - Eval: Win probabilities for "No Double" scenario
        - EvalDouble: Win probabilities for "Double/Take" scenario

        Note: For cube decisions, the position is shown from the doubler's perspective
        (the player who has the cube decision), regardless of whether the error was
        made by the doubler or the responder. This ensures consistency for score
        matrix generation and position display.

        Convert XG move notation to readable format with compound move combination and hit detection.

        XG binary uses 0-based indexing for board points in move notation, while standard
        backgammon notation uses 1-based indexing. This method adds 1 to all board point
        numbers during conversion.

        XG binary stores compound moves as separate sub-moves (e.g., 20/16 16/15), but
        standard notation combines them (e.g., 20/15*). This function:
        1. Converts 0-based to 1-based point numbering
        2. Combines consecutive sub-moves into compound moves
        3. Detects and marks hits with *
        4. Detects duplicate moves and uses (2), (3), (4) notation for doublets

        XG format: [from1, to1, from2, to2, from3, to3, from4, to4]
        Special values:
        - -1: End of move list OR bearing off (when used as destination)
        - 24: Bar (both players when entering)
        - 0-23: Board points (0-based, add 1 for standard notation)
