"""
This verb is used for the pose type of interaction with other players. It functions in a similar way to the :say verb,
but instead places the player's name at the front of the text. The actual output is done in two stages. The :emote verb
is responsible for telling the player the action s/he has just performed. The emote1 verb is then called to tell the
other objects in the room of the pose action. This provides a two stage mechanism; either or both of the verbs can be
overridden to provide special effects.
