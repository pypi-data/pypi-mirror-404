"""
This verb performs the opposite function to the `add_exit` verb. It removes `exit` from the room's list of exits. If it is
not possible to remove `exit` from the room's exit list (normally because the object that invoked the verb does not have
the required permission) then the verb returns `False`. Otherwise, a successful addition returns `True`.
