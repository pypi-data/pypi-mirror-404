"""
The `description` verb on any object is supposed to return a string or list of strings describing the object in the detail
someone would notice if they were specifically looking at it.

The default implementation of the `look` command (defined on the $room class), prints this description using the `look_self`
verb on the object. `look_self` uses `description` to obtain the text to display.
