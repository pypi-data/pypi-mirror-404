#!moo verb disfunc --on $room

"""
This verb is called by the LambdaMOO server when a player disconnects from the game.

The $room class definition of this verb moves the player home if s/he is not already there, using the :moveto verb on
the player. One possible enhancement of this verb, already implemented in some MOOs, is to include a time delay
between disconnection and movement of the player to his/her home. This would allow some tolerance of disconnection
due to network problems.
