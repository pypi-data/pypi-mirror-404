        Invoke this verb on the parent objects, if they exist.

        Often, it is useful for a child object to define a verb that augments the behavior of a verb on its parent
        object. For example, in the LambdaCore database, the root object (which is an ancestor of every other object)
        defines a verb called `description' that simply returns the value of this.description; this verb is used by
        the implementation of the look command. In many cases, a programmer would like the description of some object
        to include some non-constant part; for example, a sentence about whether or not the object was `awake' or
        `sleeping'. This sentence should be added onto the end of the normal description. The programmer would like to
        have a means of calling the normal description verb and then appending the sentence onto the end of that
        description. The function `passthrough()` is for exactly such situations.

        passthrough calls the verb with the same name as the current verb but as defined on the parent of the object
        that defines the current verb. The arguments given to passthrough are the ones given to the called verb and the
        returned value of the called verb is returned from the call to passthrough. The initial value of `this` in the
        called verb is the same as in the calling verb.

        Thus, in the example above, the child-object's description verb might have the following implementation:

            return passthrough() + "  It is " + (this.awake ? "awake." | "sleeping.")

        That is, it calls its parent's description verb and then appends to the result a sentence whose content is
        computed based on the value of a property on the object.

        In almost all cases, you will want to call `passthrough()' with the same arguments as were given to the current
        verb. This is easy to write in Python; just call passthrough(*args).
