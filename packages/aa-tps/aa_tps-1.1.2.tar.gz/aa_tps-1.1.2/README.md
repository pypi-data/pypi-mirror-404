## Requirements

- **Alliance Auth** >= 4.3.1
- **django-eveuniverse**
- **Python** >= 3.10

## Installation

1. **Activate your virtual environment:**

```bash
source /home/allianceserver/venv/auth/bin/activate
cd /home/allianceserver/myauth/
```

2. **Install the package:**

```bash
pip install aa-tps
```

3. **Add to INSTALLED_APPS** in your `local.py`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS += [
    "eveuniverse",  # if not already added
    "aatps",
]
```

4. **Run migrations and setup:**

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
python manage.py aa_tps_setup
```

5. **Restart services:**

```bash
sudo supervisorctl restart myauth:
```

## Configuration

AA-TPS works out of the box with zero configuration. However, you can customize behavior in your `local.py`:

```python
# How many months of data to retain (default: 12)
AA_TPS_RETENTION_MONTHS = 12

# Enable/disable personal stats tab (default: True)
AA_TPS_SHOW_PERSONAL_STATS = True
```

## Usage

### Automatic Data Collection

AA-TPS automatically pulls killmail data hourly for all authenticated users. The task intelligently:

- Groups characters by alliance/corporation to minimize API calls
- Deduplicates data to avoid redundant requests
- Respects ZKillboard rate limits

### Manual Data Pull

To manually trigger a data pull:

```bash
# Pull current month data
python manage.py aa_tps_pull

# With verbose output
python manage.py aa_tps_pull --verbose
```

### Viewing Statistics

1. Grant users the `aatps.basic_access` permission
1. Users can access the dashboard from the sidebar menu
1. The dashboard shows:

- Organization-wide statistics for the current month
- Interactive charts and graphs
- Leaderboard of top performers
- Personal statistics (if enabled)
- Recent activity feed

## Permissions

| Permission     | Description                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `basic_access` | Can view the activity dashboard |

## Data Flow

## API Politeness
