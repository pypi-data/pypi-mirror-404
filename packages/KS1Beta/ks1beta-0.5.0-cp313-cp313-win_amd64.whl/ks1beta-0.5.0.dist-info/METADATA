# KS-Engine: O(1) Complexity via Mathematical Induction & Inline ASM

KS-Engine is a high-performance C-extension library designed to outperform traditional numerical libraries like NumPy for specific summation series.

### Technical Breakthroughs:
1. **Mathematical Optimization (Time Complexity: O(1))**:
   While NumPy calculates the sum of a sequence using O(N) iteration, KS-Engine utilizes mathematical induction (Arithmetic Progression algorithms) to resolve the result in constant time.

2. **Hardware-Level Acceleration (Inline Assembly)**:
   The core is written in pure x86-64 assembly integrated within C. By utilizing direct register manipulation (`rax`, `rdi`) and SSE/AVX instructions (`mulsd`, `cvtsi2sd`), it achieves the theoretical limit of the CPU's execution speed.

3. **Zero-Memory Mapping**:
   Unlike NumPy arrays that require substantial RAM allocation (O(N) space), KS-Engine operates with a constant memory footprint (0.00MB additional RSS), bypassing the Python heap and preventing memory fragmentation.

4. **Compiler-Specific Optimization**:
   Compiled exclusively with GCC using `-O3 -ffast-math -march=native`, ensuring that the binary is tailored specifically for the host CPU's microarchitecture.
