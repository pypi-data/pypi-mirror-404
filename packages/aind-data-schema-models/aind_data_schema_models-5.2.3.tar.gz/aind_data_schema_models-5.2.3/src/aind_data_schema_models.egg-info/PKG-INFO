### How to add a new model class

#### tl;dr

Add new classes to the `_generators/models/*.csv` files or create new files containing `Enum`-derived classes directly in the src folder.

Run `./run_all.sh` in the top-level folder to rebuild models from their CSV files.

#### Details

The model class files, `brain_atlas.py` etc, are auto-generated. **You should never need to modify the class files directly.**

Instead, take a look at the `jinja2` templates in the folder `_generators/templates`. The filename of the template is used to pull the corresponding `.csv` file and populate the `data` DataFrame. In the template you can pull data from the various columns and use them to populate each of the fields in your class.

To re-build all the models, run the `run_all.sh` bash script in the root folder, which loops through the template files and runs them through the `generate_code` function.

There are a few special cases, e.g. if data are missing in columns they will show up as `float: nan`. See the `organizations.txt` template for examples of how to handle this.

#### Documentation

Internal registries need to be enumerated in the `aind-data-schema` file `src/aind_data_schema/utils/docs/registries_generator.py` in the variable `registries`. This list controls what classes will have documentation automatically generated and cross-referenced correctly.

If you add a new **external** registry, you need to write the documentation manually in the `aind-data-schema` file `docs/source/aind_data_schema_models/external.md`.
