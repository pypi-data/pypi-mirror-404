<!-- Row 1: Format Fragmentation & Vendor Lock-in -->
<tr>
<td>

### 🎨 Format Fragmentation & Vendor Lock-in

> "An officially recommended standard for frame-by-frame vector animations will guarantee that artists and consumers will be able to have a common media format to share and exchange vector-based video animations, instead of being forcefully limited to the jungle of incompatible proprietary or open source formats that each software produces, each coming with different scripts and libraries needed to play them back in the browser.
>
> To the point that today, even creating an animated icon will require choosing between multiple incompatible formats, making animated buttons downloaded from different websites require using multiple JavaScript libraries, each with its own syntax, to coexist in the same web page.
>
> If FBF.SVG is sanctioned as a recommendation by the W3C, it will free web artists from the burden of being restricted by the walled gardens of each graphical asset's specific code needed to make them play back. Even the most popular animation solution today for SVG, the Bodymovin format, is still not widely used because it is tied to certain specific tools to produce it, like Adobe After Effects, instead of being independent from any specific vendor.
>
> And this kind of freedom is exactly the thing that a standard is supposed to bring to the world."

— **Emanuele Sabetta**, FBF.SVG Project Lead

- SVG is DOM-based with per-frame layout/paint costs
- Canvas/WebGL use direct bitmap manipulation, bypassing DOM
- For video-like content, raster may be more efficient

**Context:**
- FBF.SVG targets 12-30 fps frame-by-frame animation, not video
- Vector scalability worth trade-off for many use cases
- Hardware acceleration improving
- Right tool for right job

**Mitigation:**
- Documentation should state performance characteristics clearly
- Document recommended use cases and limitations

- **Risk is low** (worst case: remains valid SVG without W3C blessing)
- **Benefit is high** (unified format for entire animation industry)

**Path Forward:** Pursue W3C standardization while maintaining format as de facto standard with strong reference implementation.

## Next Steps

1. **Gather Community Feedback** - Solicit arguments from broader SVG/animation community
2. **Engage Browser Vendors** - Get position statements from Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge teams
3. **Build Evidence Base** - Collect real-world use cases and adoption data
4. **Address Concerns** - Develop mitigation strategies for identified CON arguments
5. **Refine Proposal** - Incorporate feedback into formal W3C submission
