# FBF.SVG Example: panther_bird
# Multi-group frame-by-frame animation featuring a panther and bird
#
# ============================================================================
# NOTE: NON-STANDARD MULTI-GROUP FBF ANIMATION
# ============================================================================
# This is a pre-generated FBF file that uses advanced multi-group features
# not currently supported by the standard svg2fbf conversion pipeline.
#
# IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS:
# - This animation CANNOT be regenerated with current tools
# - The input_frames folder is INTENTIONALLY EMPTY
# - A future merge tool is needed to support multi-group FBF generation
# - This YAML is for reference and metadata documentation only
#
# This example demonstrates the full potential of the FBF.SVG format,
# including features that will be supported in future tooling updates.
