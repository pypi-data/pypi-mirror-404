# FBF.SVG Example: walk_cycle
# Frame-by-frame walk cycle animation
#
# Usage: uv run python svg2fbf.py examples/walk_cycle/walk_cycle.yaml
#
# ⚠️  IMPORTANT NOTE - SOURCE FRAMES UNAVAILABLE ⚠️
# The original source frames for this walk cycle animation are no longer available.
# The input_frames folder is empty because:
#   - Original SVG frames were lost during development
#   - Cannot be regenerated until a frame extraction tool is developed
#   - The only remaining version is the compiled FBF file in assets/walk_cycle.fbf.svg
#
# This example configuration is preserved for reference and documentation purposes.
# To use this example, you would need to:
#   1. Extract frames from assets/walk_cycle.fbf.svg (requires frame extraction tool)
#   2. Place extracted frames in the input_frames folder
#   3. Run the generation command above
