# FBF GENERATION CARD TEMPLATE
# ============================================================================
#
# This is a template for creating FBF (Frame-by-Frame) animation generation
# cards. Copy this file and customize it for your animation project.
#
# USAGE:
#   1. Copy this template to your animation project folder
#   2. Rename it to match your animation (e.g., "my_animation.yaml")
#   3. Fill in the metadata and generation_parameters sections
#   4. Run: svg2fbf path/to/your_animation.yaml
#
# DOCUMENTATION:
#   See docs/FBF_GENERATION_CARDS.md for complete field documentation

# ============================================================================
# METADATA SECTION
# ============================================================================
# Descriptive information about your animation that gets embedded in the
# generated FBF file. This helps with organization, searchability, and
# proper attribution.

metadata:
  # --- CORE METADATA (Strongly Recommended) ---

  title: "Your Animation Title"

# ============================================================================
# GENERATION PARAMETERS SECTION
# ============================================================================
# Technical settings that control how the FBF animation is generated from
# your SVG frames.

generation_parameters:

  # --- INPUT/OUTPUT (Required) ---

  input_folder: "path/to/your/frames"
  # Path to folder containing your SVG frame files
  # Can be relative (recommended) or absolute
  # Example: "examples/seagull", "./frames", "my_animation/input_frames"
  # svg2fbf will scan this folder for .svg files and sort them naturally

  # ALTERNATIVE TO input_folder: Explicit frame list
  # Uncomment and use 'frames' list if you need precise control over frame order
  # or want to mix frames from different folders
  #
  # frames:
  #   - "path/to/frame_001.svg"
  #   - "path/to/frame_002.svg"
  #   - "path/to/frame_003.svg"
  #   - "other_folder/extra_frame.svg"
  #
  # NOTE: If 'frames' list is present, it takes precedence over input_folder


  output_path: "path/to/output/folder"
  # Directory where the generated FBF file will be saved
  # Default: "./" (current directory)
  # Recommended: Use a dedicated output folder
  # Example: "output", "fbf_output", "build"

  filename: "your_animation.fbf.svg"
  # Name of the output FBF file
  # Default: "animation.fbf.svg"
  # Recommended: Use .fbf.svg extension and match your animation name
  # Example: "seagull.fbf.svg", "walk_cycle.fbf.svg"


  # --- ANIMATION BEHAVIOR ---

  speed: 12
  # Frames per second (fps) - controls playback speed
  # Default: 1.0
  # Common values:
  #   - 1: Very slow (useful for testing)
  #   - 12: Traditional hand-drawn animation
  #   - 24: Film standard
  #   - 30: Smooth web animation
  #   - 60: Ultra-smooth
  # Higher fps = smoother but more frames shown per second

  animation_type: "loop"
  # How the animation plays and loops
  # Default: "once"
  # Options:
  #   - "once": Play frames 1→N once, stop on last frame
  #   - "loop": Play frames 1→N, restart from 1, repeat forever
  #   - "pingpong_once": Play forward 1→N, then backward N→1, stop
  #   - "pingpong_loop": Play forward 1→N, backward N→1, repeat forever
  #
  # Use cases:
  #   - "once": One-shot effects, transitions, loading animations
  #   - "loop": Walk cycles, spinning, continuous motion
  #   - "pingpong_once": Hover effects, reversible transitions
  #   - "pingpong_loop": Breathing, pulsing, oscillating motion

  play_on_click: false
  # If true, animation waits for user click to start (instead of auto-playing)
  # Default: false
  # IMPORTANT: When true, you MUST use <object> tag in HTML, NOT <img>
  #
  # HTML requirement:
  #   <object type="image/svg+xml" data="animation.fbf.svg"></object>
  #
  # Use cases:
  #   - Interactive UI elements (buttons, icons)
  #   - User-controlled animations
  #   - Accessibility (user controls when motion starts)

  # max_frames: null
  # Maximum number of frames to process
  # Default: null (process all frames)
  # Set to integer to limit processing (useful for testing or capping file size)
  # Example: 50 (process only first 50 frames)


  # --- VISUAL SETTINGS (Optional) ---

  # backdrop: "None"
  # Background color behind all frames
  # Default: "None" (transparent)
  # Accepted formats:
  #   - "#ff0000" (hex red)
  #   - "rgb(255, 0, 0)" (RGB red)
  #   - "None" (transparent)
  #   - Named colors: "red", "blue", etc.
  # Example: "#f0f0f0" (light gray background)

  # align_mode: "top-left"
  # How frames are aligned within the FBF viewBox
  # Default: "top-left"
  # Options:
  #   - "top-left": Frames aligned to top-left corner (recommended for most)
  #   - "center": Frames centered (useful for logos, icons)
  # Technical: Controls SVG preserveAspectRatio attribute

  # keep_xml_space: false
  # Preserve xml:space="preserve" attribute on root SVG
  # Default: false
  # Set to true if frames have text with significant whitespace
  # Most users should leave this false


  # --- PRECISION SETTINGS (Optional) ---

  # digits: 28
  # Decimal precision for coordinates, paths, transforms
  # Default: 28 (maximum precision)
  # Range: 1-28
  # Trade-offs:
  #   - Higher (20-28): Maximum accuracy, larger file size
  #   - Medium (6-10): Good balance, smaller files
  #   - Lower (1-5): Heavy rounding, may cause visual artifacts
  # Recommendation: Start with 28, reduce to 6-8 for web if file size matters

  # cdigits: 28
  # Decimal precision for color values
  # Default: 28
  # Range: 1-28
  # Why separate? Colors often need different precision than coordinates
  # Can often reduce to 3-6 without visible changes
  # Recommendation: Start with 28, test lower values for your color palette


  # --- OUTPUT OPTIONS (Optional) ---

  quiet: false
  # Suppress console output during generation
  # Default: false (show progress)
  # Set to true for:
  #   - Automated scripts
  #   - Batch processing
  #   - CI/CD pipelines
  # Set to false for:
  #   - Development and testing
  #   - Learning the tool
  #   - Debugging

# ============================================================================
# NOTES
# ============================================================================
#
# YAML SYNTAX TIPS:
#   - Use 2 spaces for indentation (not tabs)
#   - Strings with special characters need quotes: "value: special"
#   - Comments start with #
#   - Boolean values: true, false (lowercase, no quotes)
#   - Numbers don't need quotes: 12, 1.5, 100
#   - null means "not set" (no quotes)
#
# PATH TIPS:
#   - Use relative paths for portability
#   - Relative paths are from your current working directory
#   - Forward slashes work on all platforms: "path/to/file"
#
# VALIDATION:
#   - Test your generation card before committing:
#     svg2fbf path/to/your_animation.yaml
#   - Use a YAML linter to check syntax:
#     yamllint your_animation.yaml
#
# VERSION CONTROL:
#   - Add generation cards to Git (they're small and text-based)
#   - Add FBF output files to .gitignore (they can be rebuilt)
#   - Document changes via commit messages
