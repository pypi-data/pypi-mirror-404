---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) - YAML/JSON/XML processor
- Basic knowledge of SVG and Python

**Installing yq:**
```bash
# macOS
brew install yq

# Linux (download latest binary)
wget https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/latest/download/yq_linux_amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/yq
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/yq

# Windows (using Chocolatey)
choco install yq

# Or download from: https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases
```

For detailed development environment setup, see **[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)**.

## Development Workflow

### Code Style

This project uses:
- **ruff** for linting and formatting
- **mypy** for type checking

Before submitting changes:

```bash
# Format code
uv run ruff format svg2fbf.py tests/

# Check linting
uv run ruff check svg2fbf.py tests/

# Type checking
uv run mypy svg2fbf.py
```

### Testing

All changes should include appropriate tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest tests/

# Run specific test
uv run pytest tests/test_frame_rendering.py

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest tests/ --cov=svg2fbf
```

## Development Setup (UV-only)

1. Install global tools (one-time):
   ```bash
   uv tool install ruff@latest
   uv tool install trufflehog@latest
   uv tool install pre-commit --with pre-commit-uv
   pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type pre-push
   ```

2. Before pushing your branch:
   ```bash
   ruff format
   ruff check --fix
   trufflehog git file://. --since-commit origin/main --branch HEAD --results=verified,unknown --fail
   ```

3. Inline exceptions:
   - Official TruffleHog: add `# trufflehog:ignore` at end of a known-safe line.
   - If using trufflehog3 (Python): add `# nosecret` or `# nosecret: <rule>`.

## Security Practices

Security is a top priority for svg2fbf. Please follow these guidelines when contributing.

> **📚 For detailed security information, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).**

### Installing Pre-commit Hooks

**REQUIRED**: Install pre-commit hooks before making any commits:

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Test the hooks
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Pre-commit hooks will automatically:
- ✅ Scan for secrets with TruffleHog
- ✅ Check code style with Ruff
- ✅ Run type checks with MyPy
- ✅ Detect private keys and large files
- ✅ Check YAML, JSON, and TOML syntax
- ✅ Prevent commits to protected branches

Pre-push hooks run 5 validation checks via `scripts/validate.sh`:
- ✅ Lint check (ruff)
- ✅ Format check (ruff format)
- ✅ Tests (pytest)
- ✅ Secret scan (trufflehog)
- ✅ GitHub Action SHA validation

### Never Commit Secrets

**CRITICAL**: Never commit sensitive information:

❌ **DO NOT commit:**
- API keys, tokens, or passwords
- Private keys or certificates
- Database credentials
- Cloud service credentials
- `.env` files with secrets
- Personal information

✅ **DO use:**
- Environment variables
- `.env` files (gitignored)
- Secrets management tools
- GitHub Secrets for CI/CD

**Example - DON'T:**
```python
API_KEY = "sk_live_1234567890abcdef"  # ❌ NEVER do this!
```

**Example - DO:**
```python
import os
API_KEY = os.environ.get("API_KEY")  # ✅ Good practice
```

### TruffleHog Secret Scanning

All commits are automatically scanned for secrets:

- **Pre-commit**: TruffleHog runs locally before each commit
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions scans all pushes and PRs
- **Configuration**: See `.trufflehog.yaml` for allowlist

If TruffleHog detects a secret:
1. **DO NOT force-commit** the secret
2. Remove the secret from your code
3. Use environment variables instead
4. If already committed, see [Removing Secrets from Git History](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository)

### Allowed Public Information

These values are **safe to commit** (configured in `.trufflehog.yaml`):

- GitHub Username: `Emasoft`
- GitHub No-Reply Email: `713559+Emasoft@users.noreply.github.com`
- Repository URL: `https://github.com/Emasoft/svg2fbf`
- Package Name: `svg2fbf`

### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities in public issues!

Instead:
1. Go to [Security tab](https://github.com/Emasoft/svg2fbf/security)
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Or email: 713559+Emasoft@users.noreply.github.com

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for full details.

### Security Checklist for Contributors

Before submitting a PR, verify:

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] No sensitive information in commit messages
- [ ] All tests pass (including security checks)
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks are installed and passing
- [ ] No large files or binaries committed
- [ ] `.gitignore` properly configured
- [ ] Environment variables used for configuration

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Automated Dependency Updates

This project uses **Dependabot** for automated dependency updates:
- Python packages (pip): Weekly on Mondays
- GitHub Actions: Weekly, pinned to commit SHAs
- npm packages (tests/): Weekly for Puppeteer

Dependabot PRs are auto-created and require passing CI before merge.

### GitHub Actions Security

All GitHub Actions are **pinned to commit SHAs** (not version tags) for supply chain security:

```yaml
# ✅ Correct - pinned to SHA
uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683  # v4.2.2

# ❌ Avoid - version tag can be moved
uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

Validate all pinned SHAs with:
```bash
python scripts/validate_action_shas.py
# Or:
just validate-action-shas
```

### Workflow Validation

The `validate-workflows.yml` workflow runs on PRs that modify `.github/workflows/`:
- Validates YAML syntax
- Checks for common issues (missing timeouts, unpinned actions)
- Verifies all pinned action SHAs exist via GitHub API

### CI Efficiency

All workflows have **concurrency controls** to cancel redundant runs, and **path filters** to skip CI on docs-only changes.

## Version Release Rules

The project enforces strict version progression rules to maintain a clean release history. **A version can only exist in ONE stage at any time.**

### Branch-Stage Mapping

| Branch   | Stage  | Publishes to |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| dev      | alpha  | GitHub only  |
| testing  | beta   | GitHub only  |
| review   | rc     | GitHub only  |
| master   | stable | GitHub + PyPI|

### Progression Rules

1. **Single Stage Rule**: Only ONE stage per version (no 0.1.2a AND 0.1.2b)
2. **Stage Progression Rule**: Stage must be LOWER than previous version's stage
3. **RC Gateway Rule**: Alpha/beta of next version only if previous reached RC or stable

### Promotion Criteria

| Promotion | Criteria | How to Verify |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| **Alpha → Beta** | Required changes completed | Code committed, features done |
| **Beta → RC** | All tests pass | `pytest` 100% pass, CI green |
| **RC → Stable** | User review approved | Manual testing, user signoff |

**Never skip stages!** Always follow: alpha → beta → rc → stable

For detailed rules and examples, see **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#version-release-rules-critical)**.

### Release Workflow

```bash
# Promote through branches
just promote-to-testing    # dev → testing
just promote-to-review     # testing → review
just promote-to-stable     # review → master

# Create releases
just release               # GitHub only (all channels)
just publish               # GitHub + PyPI (stable to PyPI)
```
