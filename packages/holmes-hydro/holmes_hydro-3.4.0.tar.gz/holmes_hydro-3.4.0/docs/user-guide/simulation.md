# Simulation

The Simulation page lets you run the hydrological model forward in time using calibrated parameters. This is useful for model validation, comparing multiple calibrations, and testing parameter transferability.

## Overview

Simulation applies pre-calibrated parameters to generate streamflow predictions. Unlike calibration, simulation does not modify parameters - it simply runs the model and evaluates performance against observations.

Common use cases:

- **Validation**: Test calibrated parameters on an independent time period
- **Model comparison**: Compare performance of different models or calibrations
- **Multimodel averaging**: Combine predictions from multiple calibrations

## Importing Calibration Results

Before running a simulation, you must import one or more calibration result files.

### Step 1: Export from Calibration

First, calibrate a model and export the parameters:

1. Go to the **Calibration** page
2. Complete a calibration (manual or automatic)
3. Click **Export parameters** to save the JSON file

### Step 2: Import to Simulation

On the Simulation page:

1. Click **Import model(s) parameters**
2. Select one or more calibration JSON files
3. The imported calibrations appear in the table

### Calibration Results Table

The table displays all imported calibrations:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| hydrological model | GR4J, Bucket, etc. |
| catchment | The catchment used for calibration |
| objective | Calibration objective (NSE, KGE, RMSE) |
| transformation | Streamflow transformation used |
| algorithm | Manual or SCE |
| date start/end | Calibration period |
| snow model | CemaNeige or none |
| parameters | Calibrated parameter values |

Click the **X** button next to any calibration to remove it.

!!! warning "Same Catchment Required"
    All imported calibrations must be for the same catchment. Attempting to import a calibration for a different catchment will show an error.

## Simulation Settings

### Simulation Period

Set the date range for simulation:

- **Start**: Beginning of the simulation period
- **End**: End of the simulation period
- **Reset** buttons: Return to the catchment's full available range

!!! tip "Validation Period"
    For proper validation, use a period not included in calibration. For example, if calibration used 1990-2000, validate on 2001-2010.

### Multimodel Simulation

When two or more calibrations are imported, enable **Multimodel simulation** to:

- Run each model independently
- Compute the average of all simulations
- Evaluate the multimodel ensemble performance

This is disabled when only one calibration is loaded.

## Running a Simulation

1. Import at least one calibration result
2. Set the simulation period
3. Optionally enable multimodel simulation
4. Click **Run**

Results appear in the charts on the right.

## Understanding Results

### Performance Metrics

Six bar charts show different performance aspects for each simulation:

| Metric | Description | Optimal |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **High flows (NSE)** | NSE with no transformation | 1 |
| **Medium flows (NSE-sqrt)** | NSE with sqrt transformation | 1 |
| **Low flows (NSE-log)** | NSE with log transformation | 1 |
| **Water balance (Mean bias)** | Average difference from observations | 1 |
| **Flow variability (Deviation bias)** | Standard deviation ratio | 1 |
| **Correlation** | Linear correlation coefficient | 1 |

Each calibration appears as a separate bar, color-coded to match the streamflow chart.

### Streamflow Chart

The time series chart shows:

- **Observations** (blue): Measured streamflow
- **Simulation 1, 2, ...** (green, purple, orange, ...): Output from each calibration
- **Multimodel** (if enabled): Average of all simulations (color depends on number of loaded calibrations)

#### Chart Interactions

- **Zoom**: Click and drag to select a time range
- **Reset**: Double-click to return to full view

### Multimodel Performance

When multimodel simulation is enabled, the performance metrics include an additional "multimodel" bar showing the ensemble's performance. Multimodel averaging often outperforms individual calibrations by reducing model structural uncertainty.

## Exporting Results

Click **Export data** to save:

1. **Simulation results (JSON)**: Configuration and performance metrics

    ```json
    {
      "calibrationConfig": [
        {"name": "simulation_1", ...},
        {"name": "simulation_2", ...}
      ],
      "config": {
        "start": "2001-01-01",
        "end": "2010-12-31",
        "multimodel": true
      },
      "results": [
        {"name": "simulation_1", "nse_none": 0.85, ...},
        {"name": "simulation_2", "nse_none": 0.82, ...},
        {"name": "multimodel", "nse_none": 0.87, ...}
      ]
    }
    ```

2. **Simulation timeseries (CSV)**: Daily values for all simulations

    ```csv
    date,simulation_1,simulation_2,multimodel,observation
    2001-01-01,12.5,13.2,12.85,11.8
    2001-01-02,11.8,12.5,12.15,12.1
    ...
    ```

## Common Issues

### Cannot Import Calibration

Error: "This isn't a valid calibrated parameter file"

- Ensure the file is a JSON file exported from HOLMES calibration
- Check that the file contains all required fields

### Cannot Import Multiple Catchments

Error: "The calibrations need to be on the same catchment"

- All imported calibrations must be for the same catchment
- Export new calibrations from the same catchment

### Simulation Already Imported

Error: "This calibration is already imported"

- The same calibration file cannot be imported twice
- Each imported calibration must have unique parameters
