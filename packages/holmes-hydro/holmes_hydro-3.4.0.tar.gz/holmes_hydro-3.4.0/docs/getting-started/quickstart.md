# Quickstart

This tutorial walks you through your first HOLMES session: starting the server, calibrating a hydrological model, and exporting your results.

## Step 1: Start the Server

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
holmes
```

The web interface opens automatically in your default browser. The terminal shows:

```
INFO:     Started server process [12345]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

If the browser doesn't open automatically, navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

## Step 2: Configure Your Model

The interface opens on the **Calibration** page. Configure your model using the settings on the left:

### General Settings

1. **Hydrological model**: Select a model to calibrate
    - **gr4j**: The GR4J model - a popular 4-parameter model
    - **bucket**: A simple bucket model for educational purposes

2. **Catchment**: Select a catchment dataset
    - HOLMES includes sample catchments for learning

3. **Snow model (optional)**: Enable snow modeling if the catchment has snow
    - **cemaneige**: The CemaNeige degree-day snow model
    - Available only for catchments with temperature data

4. **Objective criteria**: Choose how to measure model performance
    - **nse**: Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (most common)
    - **kge**: Kling-Gupta Efficiency
    - **rmse**: Root Mean Square Error

5. **Streamflow transformation**: Apply a transformation to emphasize different flow regimes
    - **High flows: none**: No transformation - emphasizes high flows
    - **Medium flows: sqrt**: Square root - balanced focus
    - **Low flows: log**: Logarithmic - emphasizes low flows

6. **Calibration start/end**: Set the date range for calibration
    - Use the "Reset" buttons to reset to the full available range

7. **Calibration algorithm**: Choose between manual and automatic calibration
    - **Manual**: Adjust parameters by hand using sliders
    - **Automatic - SCE**: Let the SCE-UA algorithm find optimal parameters

## Step 3: Run a Manual Calibration

For your first calibration, start with manual mode to understand how parameters affect streamflow:

1. Ensure **Calibration algorithm** is set to **Manual**
2. Adjust the parameter sliders in the **Manual calibration settings** panel
3. Click **Run** to see the simulated streamflow

The chart on the right shows:

- **observations**: Measured streamflow (blue line)
- **simulation**: Model output with your parameters (green line)
- The objective function value (e.g., NSE) tells you how well the model matches observations

!!! tip "Understanding Parameters"
    Each model has different parameters. For GR4J:

    - **X1**: Production store capacity (mm)
    - **X2**: Groundwater exchange coefficient (mm/day)
    - **X3**: Routing store capacity (mm)
    - **X4**: Unit hydrograph time base (days)

    Try adjusting one parameter at a time to see its effect.

## Step 4: Run an Automatic Calibration

Once you understand manual calibration, try automatic optimization:

1. Set **Calibration algorithm** to **Automatic - SCE**
2. Adjust algorithm settings if desired (default values work well):
    - **n_complexes**: Number of complexes
    - **max_evaluations**: Maximum function evaluations
    - **k_stop**: Iterations to check for convergence
    - **p_convergence_threshold**: Relative change threshold
    - **geometric_range_threshold**: Parameter space convergence
3. Click **Start calibration**

Watch as the algorithm iteratively improves the parameters. The charts update in real-time showing:

- Parameter evolution over iterations
- Objective function improvement
- Simulated vs. observed streamflow

Click **Stop calibration** at any time to halt the process.

## Step 5: Export Your Results

After calibration, export your results for use in simulation or projection:

1. Click **Export parameters** to save the calibrated parameters as JSON
    - This file can be imported into the Simulation or Projection pages
    - File format: `catchment_model_params.json`

2. Click **Export data** to save the complete calibration record:
    - Parameter evolution during calibration (JSON)
    - Timeseries data with observations and simulation (CSV)

## Next Steps

Now that you've completed your first calibration:

- **[Run a Simulation](../user-guide/simulation.md)**: Use your calibrated parameters on different time periods
- **[Create Projections](../user-guide/projection.md)**: Explore how streamflow might change under climate scenarios
- **[Explore the Interface](../user-guide/interface-overview.md)**: Learn about all available features
- **[Understand the Models](../concepts/index.md)**: Learn the theory behind GR4J and other models

!!! info "Saving Your Work"
    HOLMES can automatically save your settings between sessions. Enable **Allow save** in the settings menu (hamburger icon, top right) to persist your configuration.
