🕒 Completed Time: Time-Based Completion Tracking per Attendee (in Hours)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This addon enhances Odoo eLearning by introducing a new metric:
**Completed Time**, computed **per attendee**, which represents the
**sum of the completion times (in hours)** of the slides they have
completed.

🔧 What's Built-In vs. What's Added
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Built-in (Odoo):**

- **Progress**
  ``Progress = Number of Completed Slides / Total Number of Slides`` → A
  simple ratio, based only on slide count.

**Added by this addon:**

- **Completed Time (in hours)**
  ``Completed Time = Σ(completion_time of each completed slide)`` → A
  cumulative total of time-based effort for each attendee.

💡 Why This Matters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ⏱️ **Duration-Aware Insight** Accurately reflects how much content a
  learner has completed, by time spent rather than steps clicked.

- 👤 **Per-Attendee Computation** Each attendee has a personalized
  Completed Time value, making metrics more meaningful for trainers and
  reports.

- 📊 **Actionable Training Analytics** Trainers can better identify
  high-effort learners and tailor support accordingly.

🧪 Example
^^^^^^^^^^

For a course with 10 slides (total 20 hours), if an attendee completes:

- 1 slide of 15 hours → **Progress**: 10% → **Completed Time**: 15h

--------------

This addon is ideal for serious training environments, compliance
programs, and professional development, where **time commitment** is a
better measure than simple slide count.
