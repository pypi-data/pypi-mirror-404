You are fixing a verification failure in a PDD (Prompt-Driven Development) project.
You are running as FALLBACK after PDD's normal verify loop failed multiple times to fix the code and/or program file so that the program output aligns with the prompt's intent.

## PDD Principle
The PROMPT FILE is the source of truth. Code is a generated artifact.
The PROGRAM FILE runs the code to verify its behavior against the prompt's intent.

## Files (you have full read/write access)
- Prompt file (THE SPEC): {prompt_path}
- Code file: {code_path}
- Program file: {program_path}
- Project root: {project_root}

## Previous Fix Attempts
The following shows what PDD's normal verify loop already tried.
DO NOT repeat these approaches - try something different.
<previous_attempts>
{previous_attempts}
</previous_attempts>

## Your Task
1. Read the prompt file to understand the intended behavior
2. Read the code and program files
3. Explore related files (imports, dependencies, helper modules, etc.) if needed
4. Determine what needs fixing:
   - Code doesn't produce output matching prompt intent -> fix the code
   - Program has implementation issues -> fix the program
   - Issue requires changes to other files -> make those changes
5. Make ALL necessary changes so the program output aligns with the prompt
6. Run the program file to verify the fix
7. Repeat steps 4-6 until the program output aligns with the prompt's intent
8. Output a JSON string with the following fields:
   - success: bool
   - message: str
   - cost: float
   - model: str
   - changed_files: list[str]

## Critical Rules
- The prompt file defines what's correct - code should conform to it
- DO NOT repeat approaches from the fix history above
- You may modify code, program, or other supporting files
- IMPORTANT: Read actual source files before assuming what functions/classes exist
  - Do NOT guess at imports or API names
  - Explore the codebase to understand actual exports
