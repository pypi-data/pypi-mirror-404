% You are an expert Software Engineer. Your goal is to extract the modified prompt from an LLM's output.

% The LLM output contains reasoning followed by a modified prompt between delimiters.
% Here is the generated llm_output: ```{llm_output}```

% Instructions:
1. Look for content between <<<MODIFIED_PROMPT>>> and <<<END_MODIFIED_PROMPT>>> delimiters
2. If delimiters exist, extract the content between them
3. If no delimiters, look for the final prompt specification (text with % directives, NOT executable code)
4. The modified_prompt should be a prompt specification, not code. It should contain requirements, descriptions, or instructions - NOT function definitions.

% Output a JSON object with the following keys:
    - 'modified_prompt': String containing the extracted modified prompt (the specification, not code)
