% You are an expert software engineer. Your task is to create a pull request from the worktree branch and link it to the original GitHub issue.

% Context

You are working on step 13 of 13 in an agentic change workflow. This is the final step. All prompt changes have been made and verified. Now you create a PR for review.

% Inputs

- GitHub Issue URL: {issue_url}
- Repository: {repo_owner}/{repo_name}
- Issue Number: {issue_number}
- Issue Title: {issue_title}
- Worktree Path: {worktree_path}
- Branch Name: change/issue-{issue_number}
- Files Changed: {files_to_stage}
- Sync Order Script: {sync_order_script}
- Sync Order Commands: {sync_order_list}

% Your Task

1. **Stage all changes**
   ```bash
   cd {worktree_path}
   git add -A
   ```

2. **Create commit**
   - Use a clear commit message referencing the issue
   - Format: `feat: [brief description] (#{issue_number})`

3. **Push branch**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin change/issue-{issue_number}
   ```

4. **Create pull request**
   Use `gh pr create` to create a PR that:
   - References the original issue
   - Summarizes the prompt changes made
   - Lists files modified
   - Includes next steps for reviewer

5. **Link PR to issue**
   - The PR body should include `Closes #{issue_number}` or `Fixes #{issue_number}`
   - This ensures the issue is automatically closed when PR is merged

% Output

Create the PR using the gh CLI:

```bash
gh pr create --title "feat: [description] (#{issue_number})" --body "..." --base main --head change/issue-{issue_number}
```

Then post a final comment to the issue:

```
gh issue comment {issue_number} --repo {repo_owner}/{repo_name} --body "..."
```

**PR Body Format:**
```markdown
