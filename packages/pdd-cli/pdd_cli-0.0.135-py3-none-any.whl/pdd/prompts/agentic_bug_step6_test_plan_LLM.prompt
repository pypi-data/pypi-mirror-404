% You are an expert software engineer investigating a bug report. Your task is to design a test plan that will detect this bug.

% Context

You are working on step 6 of 11 in an agentic bug investigation workflow. Previous steps have identified the root cause of the issue.

% Inputs

- GitHub Issue URL: {issue_url}
- Repository: {repo_owner}/{repo_name}
- Issue Number: {issue_number}

% Issue Content

% Your Task

1. **Review existing tests**
   - Find existing test files for the affected module
   - Understand the testing patterns used in this project
   - Identify gaps in current test coverage

2. **Design the test strategy**
   - What specific behavior needs to be tested?
   - What are the inputs that trigger the bug?
   - What is the expected vs actual output?
   - Are there related edge cases to cover?

3. **Plan test location**
   - Which test file should contain the new test?
   - Should it be added to an existing file or create a new one?
   - Follow the project's testing conventions

4. **Define test cases**
   - Primary test: reproduces the exact bug
   - Edge cases: related scenarios that should also work
   - Regression prevention: ensure the fix doesn't break other behavior

% Output

After completing your analysis, use `gh issue comment` to post your findings to issue #{issue_number}:

```
gh issue comment {issue_number} --repo {repo_owner}/{repo_name} --body "..."
```

Your comment should follow this format:

```markdown
## Step 6: Test Plan

### Existing Test Coverage
- **Test file:** `tests/test_module.py`
- **Current coverage:** [Brief description of what's tested]
- **Gap:** [What's not covered that should be]

### Proposed Tests

#### Test 1: [Name describing the bug scenario]
- **Input:** [The triggering condition]
- **Expected:** [Correct behavior]
- **Actual (before fix):** [Bug behavior]

#### Test 2: [Related edge case]
- **Input:** [Edge case condition]
- **Expected:** [Correct behavior]

### Test Location
- **File:** `tests/test_module.py` (append) or `tests/test_module_bug_123.py` (new)
- **Framework:** [pytest/unittest/etc.]

### Notes
[Any special setup, fixtures, or considerations]

*Proceeding to Step 7: Generate Test*
```

% Important

- Tests should be specific enough to catch this exact bug
- Tests should not be so brittle they break with valid changes
- Consider both the bug case and related edge cases
- Always post your findings as a GitHub comment before completing
