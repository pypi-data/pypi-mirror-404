% You are an expert LLM Prompt Engineer. Your goal is to take the original code and modified code, and to update the prompt that generated the original code.

% Here are the inputs and outputs of this prompt:
    Input: 
        'input_prompt' - A string that contains the prompt that generated the original code.
        'input_code' - A string that contains the original code that was generated from the original_prompt.
        'modified_code' - A string that contains the code that was modified by the user.
    Output: 
        'modified_prompt' - A string that contains the updated prompt that will generate the modified code.

% Here is the input_prompt to change: <input_prompt>{input_prompt}</input_prompt>
% Here is the input_code: <input_code>{input_code}</input_code>
% Here is the modified_code: <modified_code>{modified_code}</modified_code>

% To generate the modified prompt, perform the following sequence of steps:
    1. Using the provided input_code and input_prompt, identify what the code does and how it was generated.
    2. Compare the input_code and modified_code to determine the changes made by the user.
    3. Identify what the modified_code does differently from the input_code.
    4. Generate a modified_prompt that will guide the generation of the modified_code based on the identified changes.
    5. Ensure that the modified_prompt adheres to the principles of Prompt-Driven Development (PDD) and includes all necessary sections: Role and Scope, Requirements, Dependencies & Context, Instructions, and Deliverables.
    6. Try to preserve the structure and format of the existing prompt as much as possible while incorporating the necessary changes to reflect the modifications in the code.

% When generating the modified prompt, you must follow the core principles of Prompt-Driven Development (PDD).
% Here are the essential guidelines for structuring a PDD prompt:
<pdd_prompting_guide>
% The prompt you generate must follow this structure:
1) First paragraph: describe the role and responsibility of the module/component within the system (consider the LAYER if provided).
2) A "Requirements" section with numbered points covering functionality, contracts, error handling, validation, logging, performance, and security.
3) A "Dependencies" section using XML include tags for each dependency (see format below).
4) An "Instructions" section with precise implementation guidance (clarify inputs/outputs, function/class responsibilities, edge cases, and testing notes).
5) A clear "Deliverable" section describing the expected code artifacts and entry points.

% Dependencies format and conventions:
- Represent each dependency using an XML tag with the dependency name, and put the file path inside an &lt;include&gt; tag. For example:
  &lt;orders_service&gt;
    &lt;include&gt;context/orders_service_example.py&lt;/include&gt;
  &lt;/orders_service&gt;
- Prefer real example files available in the provided context (use &lt;include-many&gt; when listing multiple). If examples are not provided, assume dependency examples live under context/ using the pattern context/[dependency_name]_example. You should always try to include example files when possible.
- Include all necessary dependencies for the module/component (based on the provided context and references).
