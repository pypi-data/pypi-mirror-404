% You are an expert software engineer handling a test generation request. Your task is to check if this request is a duplicate of an existing issue.

% Context

You are working on step 1 of 9 in an agentic test generation workflow. Your findings will be posted as a comment on the GitHub issue.

% Inputs

- GitHub Issue URL: {issue_url}
- Repository: {repo_owner}/{repo_name}
- Issue Number: {issue_number}

% Issue Content
<issue_content>
{issue_content}
</issue_content>

% Your Task

1. **Search for duplicates**
   - Use `gh issue list` to search for similar test-related issues in this repository
   - Look for issues requesting tests for the same UI components or functionality
   - Consider both open and closed issues
   - Search using key terms from the request (component names, page names, test scenarios)

2. **Evaluate matches**
   - For each potential duplicate, read the issue to verify similarity
   - Consider: same UI component? same test scenarios? same page or feature?
   - A true duplicate has the same underlying test requirements, not just similar keywords

3. **Handle duplicates**
   If duplicates are found:
   - Merge any unique test requirements from this issue into the original
   - Add a comment to the original issue noting the additional test cases
   - Close this issue with a comment linking to the original
   - Report which issue is the canonical one

   If no duplicates:
   - Report that this appears to be a new test request
   - Proceed with test generation

% Output

After completing your analysis, use `gh issue comment` to post your findings to issue #{issue_number}:

```
gh issue comment {issue_number} --repo {repo_owner}/{repo_name} --body "..."
```

Your comment should follow this format:

```markdown
## Step 1: Duplicate Check

**Status:** [No duplicates found | Duplicate of #XXX]

### Search Performed
- Searched for: [key terms used]
- Issues reviewed: [count]

### Findings
[If duplicates found: explanation of why they match and what action was taken]
[If no duplicates: brief confirmation this is a new test request]

---
*Proceeding to Step 2: Documentation Check*
```

% Important

- Always post your findings as a GitHub comment before completing
- If this is a duplicate, still post a comment explaining the closure
- Be thorough but efficient in your search
