% You are an expert software engineer investigating a bug report. Your task is to create a draft pull request with the failing tests and link it to the issue.

% Context

You are working on step 10 of 11 (final step) in an agentic bug investigation workflow. Previous steps have generated and verified both unit tests and E2E tests that detect the bug.

% Inputs

- GitHub Issue URL: {issue_url}
- Repository: {repo_owner}/{repo_name}
- Issue Number: {issue_number}

% Worktree Information

You are operating in an isolated git worktree at: {worktree_path}
This worktree is already checked out to branch `fix/issue-{issue_number}`.
Do NOT create a new branch - just stage, commit, and push.

% Files to Stage

**IMPORTANT: Only stage these specific files:**
{files_to_stage}

% Your Task

1. **Prepare the commit**
   - You are already on branch `fix/issue-{issue_number}` in an isolated worktree
   - **CRITICAL: Stage ONLY the test file(s) created in Steps 7 and 9**
   - Get the exact file paths from:
     - Step 7's `FILES_CREATED:` or `FILES_MODIFIED:` output (unit tests)
     - Step 9's `E2E_FILES_CREATED:` or `E2E_FILES_MODIFIED:` output (E2E tests)
   - Stage each file individually: `git add <exact_file_path>`
   - **DO NOT use `git add .` or `git add -A`** - these will stage unrelated files and pollute the PR
   - Verify only the intended files are staged: `git status --short` (should show only the test file(s))
   - Commit with a descriptive message referencing the issue

2. **Create the draft PR**
   - Push the branch to origin
   - Create a draft pull request using `gh pr create --draft`
   - Link to the issue using "Fixes #{issue_number}" in the PR body

3. **Post final summary**
   - Comment on the issue with PR link and next steps for the fix

4. **Include PDD fix command**
   - Extract code file path from Step 5's `**Location:**` field (strip the `:line_number` suffix)
   - Use test file path from Step 7's `FILES_CREATED:` or test file section
   - Search repo for matching prompt file: `find . -name "*.prompt" -type f`
   - Derive module name from code file (e.g., `pdd/foo.py` -> `foo`)
   - Use verification program: `context/{{module_name}}_example.py`
   - Include a ready-to-run `pdd fix` command in your GitHub comment
   - If no prompt file or verification program exists, include a note that they must be created first

% PR Creation Command

```bash
gh pr create --draft --title "Add failing tests for #{issue_number}" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
Adds failing tests that detect the bug reported in #{issue_number}.

## Test Files
- Unit test: `{{unit_test_file_path}}`
- E2E test: `{{e2e_test_file_path}}` (if applicable)

## What This PR Contains
- Failing unit test that reproduces the reported bug
- Failing E2E test that verifies the bug at integration level (if applicable)
- Tests are verified to fail on current code and will pass once the bug is fixed

## Root Cause
{{root_cause_summary}}

## Next Steps
1. [ ] Implement the fix at the identified location
2. [ ] Verify the unit test passes
3. [ ] Verify the E2E test passes
4. [ ] Run full test suite
5. [ ] Mark PR as ready for review

Fixes #{issue_number}

```

% Output

After creating the PR, use `gh issue comment` to post your final report to issue #{issue_number}:

```
gh issue comment {issue_number} --repo {repo_owner}/{repo_name} --body "..."
```

Your comment should follow this format:

## Step 10: Draft PR Created

### Pull Request
**PR #{{pr_number}}:** [{{pr_title}}]({{pr_url}})

### Branch
`fix/issue-{issue_number}`

### What's Included
- Failing unit test at `{{unit_test_file_path}}`
- Failing E2E test at `{{e2e_test_file_path}}` (if applicable)
- Commits: {{commit_count}}

### Next Steps for Maintainers
1. Review the failing tests to understand the expected behavior
2. Implement the fix at the identified location
3. Verify both unit and E2E tests pass with your fix
4. Run full test suite to check for regressions
5. Mark the PR as ready for review

### PDD Fix Command

To auto-fix this bug using PDD:

```bash
cd {{worktree_path}}
pdd --force fix --loop --max-attempts 5 --verification-program context/{{module_name}}_example.py {{prompt_file}} {{code_file_path}} {{test_file_path}}
```

---
*Investigation complete. A draft PR with failing tests has been created and linked to this issue.*
```

% Important

- Create a DRAFT PR (not ready for review) since it only contains the failing tests
- The PR should clearly state that a fix is still needed
- Use "Fixes #{issue_number}" to auto-link the PR to the issue
- Do NOT create a new branch - you are already on the correct branch in the worktree
- Include both unit test files (Step 7) and E2E test files (Step 9) if both exist
- Always post your findings as a GitHub comment before completing
