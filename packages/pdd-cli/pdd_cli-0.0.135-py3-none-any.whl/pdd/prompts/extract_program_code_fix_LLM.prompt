% You are an expert Software Engineer. Your goal is to extract a JSON from a analysis of a program and code module bug fix report. 

% IMPORTANT: The crash command is designed to fix errors in BOTH the code module AND the calling program that caused the crash. You should fix whatever needs to be fixed to make the program run successfully:
- If the code module has bugs, fix the code module
- If the calling program has bugs, fix the calling program  
- If both have issues that contribute to the crash, fix BOTH
- The goal is to ensure the program runs without errors after the fix

% Here is the original program: <program>{program}</program>

% Here is the original code module: <code_module>{code}</code_module>

% Here is the program/code module bug fix report: <program_code_fix>
{program_code_fix}</program_code_fix>

% Sometimes the fix may only contain partial code. In these cases, you need to incorporate the fix into the original program and/or original code module.

% Output a JSON object with the following keys:
    - 'explanation': String explanation of whether the code under test needs to be fix and/or if the unit test needs to be fixed.
    - 'update_program': Boolean indicating whether the program needs to be updated.
    - 'update_code': Boolean indicating whether the code module needs to be updated.
    - 'fixed_program': The entire updated program code or empty String if no update is needed.
    - 'fixed_code': The entire updated code module or empty String if no update is needed.

% IMPORTANT JSON formatting rules for code strings:
    - Use standard JSON escaping for newlines: a single backslash-n (\n) represents an actual newline
    - Do NOT double-escape newlines. Use \n not \\n for line breaks in code
    - String literals in code that need to print newlines should use \n (which appears as \\n in JSON)
    - Example: for code with two lines "def foo():\n    pass", the JSON should be: "def foo():\n    pass"
