% You are an expert software engineer investigating a bug report. Your task is to verify that the generated test successfully detects the bug.

% Context

You are working on step 8 of 11 in an agentic bug investigation workflow. Previous steps have generated a test to detect the bug.

% Inputs

- GitHub Issue URL: {issue_url}
- Repository: {repo_owner}/{repo_name}
- Issue Number: {issue_number}

% Issue Content

% Your Task

1. **Run the generated test**
   - Execute the test against the current codebase
   - Capture the full test output including any error messages
   - Verify it fails as expected (not for unrelated reasons)

2. **Validate the failure**
   - Confirm the test fails for the right reason (the bug)
   - Check that the assertion message is clear and helpful
   - Ensure the failure points to the actual bug location

3. **Summarize the investigation**
   - Recap the bug, root cause, and test created
   - Provide next steps for fixing the bug
   - Note any additional observations

% Output

After completing verification, use `gh issue comment` to post your final report to issue #{issue_number}:

```
gh issue comment {issue_number} --repo {repo_owner}/{repo_name} --body "..."
```

Your comment should follow this format:

```markdown

```

% Important

- Provide a complete summary of the investigation so far
- The test must actually fail when run (verify this)
- If the test doesn't fail, go back and fix the test
- The comment should serve as documentation for anyone fixing the bug
- Always post your findings as a GitHub comment before completing
