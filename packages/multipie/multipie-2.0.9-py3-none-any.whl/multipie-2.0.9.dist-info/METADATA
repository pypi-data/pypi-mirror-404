# [MultiPie](https://cmt-mu.github.io/MultiPie/)

A Python library for a database of crystallographic (magnetic) point and space groups, and constructing Symmetry-Adapted Multipole Basis (SAMB).
Molecular or crystal structures and generated SAMB are best drawn by using [QtDraw](https://github.com/CMT-MU/QtDraw).

- **Authors**: Hiroaki Kusunose and Rikuto Oiwa

- **Installation**: MultiPie can be installed from PyPI using pip on Python >= 3.11:
  ```
  pip install multipie
  ```
  You can also visit
  [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/multipie/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/CMT-MU/MultiPie) to download the source.

- **Requirements**:
  - This library optionally requires [TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) environment to create LaTeX and PDF files.
  - Molecular or crystal structure files are optionally generated by [QtDraw](https://github.com/CMT-MU/QtDraw).

- **Citing MultiPie and QtDraw**: If you are using MultiPie and/or QtDraw in your scientific research, please help our scientific visibility by citing our work:
