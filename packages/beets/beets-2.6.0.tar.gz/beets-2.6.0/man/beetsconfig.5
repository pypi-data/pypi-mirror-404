.SH NAME
beetsconfig \- beets configuration file
.sp
Beets has an extensive configuration system that lets you customize nearly every
aspect of its operation. To configure beets, you create a file called
\fBconfig.yaml\fP\&. The location of the file depends on your platform (type \fBbeet
config \-p\fP to see the path on your system):
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
On Unix\-like OSes, write \fB~/.config/beets/config.yaml\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
On Windows, use \fB%APPDATA%\ebeets\econfig.yaml\fP\&. This is usually in a
directory like \fBC:\eUsers\eYou\eAppData\eRoaming\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
On OS X, you can use either the Unix location or \fB~/Library/Application
Support/beets/config.yaml\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can launch your text editor to create or update your configuration by typing
\fBbeet config \-e\fP\&. (See the \fI\%config\fP command for details.) It is also
possible to customize the location of the configuration file and even use
multiple layers of configuration. See \fI\%Configuration Location\fP, below.
.sp
The config file uses \X'tty: link https://yaml.org/'\fI\%YAML\fP\X'tty: link' syntax. You can use the full power of YAML, but most
configuration options are simple key/value pairs. This means your config file
will look like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
option: value
another_option: foo
bigger_option:
    key: value
    foo: bar
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In YAML, you will need to use spaces (not tabs!) to indent some lines. If you
have questions about more sophisticated syntax, take a look at the \X'tty: link https://yaml.org/'\fI\%YAML\fP\X'tty: link'
documentation.
.sp
The rest of this page enumerates the dizzying litany of configuration options
available in beets. You might also want to see an \fI\%example\fP\&.

.SH GLOBAL OPTIONS
.sp
These options control beets’ global operation.
.SS library
.sp
Path to the beets library file. By default, beets will use a file called
\fBlibrary.db\fP alongside your configuration file.
.SS directory
.sp
The directory to which files will be copied/moved when adding them to the
library. Defaults to a folder called \fBMusic\fP in your home directory.
.SS plugins
.sp
A space\-separated list of plugin module names to load. See \fI\%Using Plugins\fP\&.
.SS include
.sp
A space\-separated list of extra configuration files to include. Filenames are
relative to the directory containing \fBconfig.yaml\fP\&.
.SS pluginpath
.sp
Directories to search for plugins. Each Python file or directory in a plugin
path represents a plugin and should define a subclass of \fI\%beets.plugins.BeetsPlugin\fP\&. A plugin
can then be loaded by adding the plugin name to the \fBplugins\fP configuration.
The plugin path can either be a single string or a list of strings—so, if you
have multiple paths, format them as a YAML list like so:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
pluginpath:
    \- /path/one
    \- /path/two
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS ignore
.sp
A list of glob patterns specifying file and directory names to be ignored when
importing. By default, this consists of \fB\&.*\fP, \fB*~\fP, \fBSystem Volume
Information\fP, \fBlost+found\fP (i.e., beets ignores Unix\-style hidden files,
backup files, and directories that appears at the root of some Linux and Windows
filesystems).
.SS ignore_hidden
.sp
Either \fByes\fP or \fBno\fP; whether to ignore hidden files when importing. On
Windows, the “Hidden” property of files is used to detect whether or not a file
is hidden. On OS X, the file’s “IsHidden” flag is used to detect whether or not
a file is hidden. On both OS X and other platforms (excluding Windows), files
(and directories) starting with a dot are detected as hidden files.
.SS replace
.sp
A set of regular expression/replacement pairs to be applied to all filenames
created by beets. Typically, these replacements are used to avoid confusing
problems or errors with the filesystem (for example, leading dots, which hide
files on Unix, and trailing whitespace, which is illegal on Windows). To
override these substitutions, specify a mapping from regular expression to
replacement strings. For example, \fB[xy]: z\fP will make beets replace all
instances of the characters \fBx\fP or \fBy\fP with the character \fBz\fP\&.
.sp
If you do change this value, be certain that you include at least enough
substitutions to avoid causing errors on your operating system. Here are the
default substitutions used by beets, which are sufficient to avoid unexpected
behavior on all popular platforms:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
replace:
    \(aq[\e\e/]\(aq: _
    \(aq^\e.\(aq: _
    \(aq[\ex00\-\ex1f]\(aq: _
    \(aq[<>:\(dq\e?\e*\e|]\(aq: _
    \(aq\e.$\(aq: _
    \(aq\es+$\(aq: \(aq\(aq
    \(aq^\es+\(aq: \(aq\(aq
    \(aq^\-\(aq: _
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
These substitutions remove forward and back slashes, leading dots, and control
characters—all of which is a good idea on any OS. The fourth line removes the
Windows “reserved characters” (useful even on Unix for compatibility with
Windows\-influenced network filesystems like Samba). Trailing dots and trailing
whitespace, which can cause problems on Windows clients, are also removed.
.sp
When replacements other than the defaults are used, it is possible that they
will increase the length of the path. In the scenario where this leads to a
conflict with the maximum filename length, the default replacements will be used
to resolve the conflict and beets will display a warning.
.sp
Note that paths might contain special characters such as typographical quotes
(\fB“”\fP). With the configuration above, those will not be replaced as they don’t
match the typewriter quote (\fB\(dq\fP). To also strip these special characters, you
can either add them to the replacement list or use the \fI\%asciify_paths\fP
configuration option below.
.SS path_sep_replace
.sp
A string that replaces the path separator (for example, the forward slash \fB/\fP
on Linux and MacOS, and the backward slash \fB\e\e\fP on Windows) when generating
filenames with beets. This option is related to \fI\%replace\fP, but is distinct
from it for technical reasons.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Changing this option is potentially dangerous. For example, setting it to
the actual path separator could create directories in unexpected locations.
Use caution when changing it and always try it out on a small number of
files before applying it to your whole library.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Default: \fB_\fP\&.
.SS asciify_paths
.sp
Convert all non\-ASCII characters in paths to ASCII equivalents.
.sp
For example, if your path template for singletons is \fBsingletons/$title\fP and
the title of a track is “Café”, then the track will be saved as
\fBsingletons/Cafe.mp3\fP\&. The changes take place before applying the
\fI\%replace\fP configuration and are roughly equivalent to wrapping all your
path templates in the \fB%asciify{}\fP \fI\%template function\fP\&.
.sp
This uses the \X'tty: link https://pypi.org/project/Unidecode'\fI\%unidecode module\fP\X'tty: link' which is
language agnostic, so some characters may be transliterated from a different
language than expected. For example, Japanese kanji will usually use their
Chinese readings.
.sp
Default: \fBno\fP\&.
.SS art_filename
.sp
When importing album art, the name of the file (without extension) where the
cover art image should be placed. This is a template string, so you can use any
of the syntax available to \fI\%Path Formats\fP\&. Defaults to \fBcover\fP
(i.e., images will be named \fBcover.jpg\fP or \fBcover.png\fP and placed in the
album’s directory).
.SS threaded
.sp
Either \fByes\fP or \fBno\fP, indicating whether the autotagger should use multiple
threads. This makes things substantially faster by overlapping work: for
example, it can copy files for one album in parallel with looking up data in
MusicBrainz for a different album. You may want to disable this when debugging
problems with the autotagger. Defaults to \fByes\fP\&.
.SS format_item
.sp
Format to use when listing \fIindividual items\fP with the \fI\%list\fP command
and other commands that need to print out items. Defaults to \fB$artist \- $album
\- $title\fP\&. The \fB\-f\fP command\-line option overrides this setting.
.sp
It used to be named \fBlist_format_item\fP\&.
.SS format_album
.sp
Format to use when listing \fIalbums\fP with \fI\%list\fP and other commands.
Defaults to \fB$albumartist \- $album\fP\&. The \fB\-f\fP command\-line option overrides
this setting.
.sp
It used to be named \fBlist_format_album\fP\&.
.SS sort_item
.sp
Default sort order to use when fetching items from the database. Defaults to
\fBartist+ album+ disc+ track+\fP\&. Explicit sort orders override this default.
.SS sort_album
.sp
Default sort order to use when fetching albums from the database. Defaults to
\fBalbumartist+ album+\fP\&. Explicit sort orders override this default.
.SS sort_case_insensitive
.sp
Either \fByes\fP or \fBno\fP, indicating whether the case should be ignored when
sorting lexicographic fields. When set to \fBno\fP, lower\-case values will be
placed after upper\-case values (e.g., \fIBar Qux foo\fP), while \fByes\fP would result
in the more expected \fIBar foo Qux\fP\&. Default: \fByes\fP\&.
.SS original_date
.sp
Either \fByes\fP or \fBno\fP, indicating whether matched albums should have their
\fByear\fP, \fBmonth\fP, and \fBday\fP fields set to the release date of the
\fIoriginal\fP version of an album rather than the selected version of the release.
That is, if this option is turned on, then \fByear\fP will always equal
\fBoriginal_year\fP and so on. Default: \fBno\fP\&.
.SS overwrite_null
.sp
This confusingly\-named option indicates which fields have meaningful \fBnull\fP
values. If an album or track field is in the corresponding list, then an
existing value for this field in an item in the database can be overwritten with
\fBnull\fP\&. By default, however, \fBnull\fP is interpreted as information about the
field being unavailable, so it would not overwrite existing values. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
overwrite_null:
    album: [\(dqalbumid\(dq]
    track: [\(dqtitle\(dq, \(dqdate\(dq]
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS artist_credit
.sp
Either \fByes\fP or \fBno\fP, indicating whether matched tracks and albums should
use the artist credit, rather than the artist. That is, if this option is turned
on, then \fBartist\fP will contain the artist as credited on the release.
.SS per_disc_numbering
.sp
A boolean controlling the track numbering style on multi\-disc releases. By
default (\fBper_disc_numbering: no\fP), tracks are numbered per\-release, so the
first track on the second disc has track number N+1 where N is the number of
tracks on the first disc. If this \fBper_disc_numbering\fP is enabled, then the
first (non\-pregap) track on each disc always has track number 1.
.sp
If you enable \fBper_disc_numbering\fP, you will likely want to change your
\fI\%Path Format Configuration\fP also to include \fB$disc\fP before \fB$track\fP to make
filenames sort correctly in album directories. For example, you might want to
use a path format like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
paths:
    default: $albumartist/$album%aunique{}/$disc\-$track $title
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When this option is off (the default), even “pregap” hidden tracks are numbered
from one, not zero, so other track numbers may appear to be bumped up by one.
When it is on, the pregap track for each disc can be numbered zero.
.SS aunique
.sp
These options are used to generate a string that is guaranteed to be unique
among all albums in the library who share the same set of keys.
.sp
The defaults look like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
aunique:
    keys: albumartist album
    disambiguators: albumtype year label catalognum albumdisambig releasegroupdisambig
    bracket: \(aq[]\(aq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
See \fI\%Album Disambiguation\fP for more details.
.SS sunique
.sp
Like \fI\%aunique\fP above for albums, these options control the
generation of a unique string to disambiguate \fIsingletons\fP that share similar
metadata.
.sp
The defaults look like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
sunique:
    keys: artist title
    disambiguators: year trackdisambig
    bracket: \(aq[]\(aq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
See \fI\%Singleton Disambiguation\fP for more details.
.SS terminal_encoding
.sp
The text encoding, as \X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings'\fI\%known to Python\fP\X'tty: link', to use
for messages printed to the standard output. It’s also used to read messages
from the standard input. By default, this is determined automatically from the
locale environment variables.
.SS clutter
.sp
When beets imports all the files in a directory, it tries to remove the
directory if it’s empty. A directory is considered empty if it only contains
files whose names match the glob patterns in \fBclutter\fP, which should be a list
of strings. The default list consists of “Thumbs.DB” and “.DS_Store”.
.sp
The importer only removes recursively searched subdirectories—the top\-level
directory you specify on the command line is never deleted.
.SS max_filename_length
.sp
Set the maximum number of characters in a filename, after which names will be
truncated. By default, beets tries to ask the filesystem for the correct
maximum.
.SS id3v23
.sp
By default, beets writes MP3 tags using the ID3v2.4 standard, the latest version
of ID3. Enable this option to instead use the older ID3v2.3 standard, which is
preferred by certain older software such as Windows Media Player.
.SS va_name
.sp
Sets the albumartist for various\-artist compilations. Defaults to \fB\(aqVarious
Artists\(aq\fP (the MusicBrainz standard). Affects other sources, such as
\fI\%Discogs Plugin\fP, too.
.SH UI OPTIONS
.sp
The options that allow for customization of the visual appearance of the console
interface.
.SS color
.sp
Either \fByes\fP or \fBno\fP; whether to use color in console output. Turn this off
if your terminal doesn’t support ANSI colors.
.SS colors
.sp
The colors that are used throughout the user interface. These are only used if
the \fBcolor\fP option is set to \fByes\fP\&. See the default configuration:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

Controls line wrapping on non\-Unix systems. On Unix systems, the width of the
terminal is detected automatically. If this fails, or on non\-Unix systems, the
specified value is used as a fallback. Defaults to \fB80\fP characters:

.SS length_diff_thresh
.sp
Beets compares the length of the imported track with the length the metadata
source provides. If any tracks differ by at least \fBlength_diff_thresh\fP
seconds, they will be colored with \fBtext_highlight\fP\&. Below this threshold,
different track lengths are colored with \fBtext_highlight_minor\fP\&.
\fBlength_diff_thresh\fP does not impact which releases are selected in autotagger
matching or distance score calculation (see \fI\%Autotagger Matching Options\fP,
\fBdistance_weights\fP and \fI\%colors\fP):

When importing, beets will read several options to configure the visuals of the
import dialogue. There are two layouts controlling how horizontal space and line
wrapping is dealt with: \fBcolumn\fP and \fBnewline\fP\&. The indentation of the
respective elements of the import UI can also be configured. For example setting
\fB2\fP for \fBmatch_header\fP will indent the very first block of a proposed match
by two characters in the terminal:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
ui:

        layout: column
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH IMPORTER OPTIONS
.sp
The options that control the \fI\%import\fP command are indented under the
\fBimport:\fP key. For example, you might have a section in your configuration
file that looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
import:
    write: yes
    copy: yes
    resume: no
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
These options are available in this section:
.SS write
.sp
Either \fByes\fP or \fBno\fP, controlling whether metadata (e.g., ID3) tags are
written to files when using \fBbeet import\fP\&. Defaults to \fByes\fP\&. The \fB\-w\fP and
\fB\-W\fP command\-line options override this setting.
.SS copy
.sp
Either \fByes\fP or \fBno\fP, indicating whether to \fBcopy\fP files into the library
directory when using \fBbeet import\fP\&. Defaults to \fByes\fP\&. Can be overridden
with the \fB\-c\fP and \fB\-C\fP command\-line options.
.sp
The option is ignored if \fBmove\fP is enabled (i.e., beets can move or copy files
but it doesn’t make sense to do both).
.SS move
.sp
Either \fByes\fP or \fBno\fP, indicating whether to \fBmove\fP files into the library
directory when using \fBbeet import\fP\&. Defaults to \fBno\fP\&.
.sp
The effect is similar to the \fBcopy\fP option but you end up with only one copy
of the imported file. (“Moving” works even across filesystems; if necessary,
beets will copy and then delete when a simple rename is impossible.) Moving
files can be risky—it’s a good idea to keep a backup in case beets doesn’t do
what you expect with your files.
.sp
This option \fIoverrides\fP \fBcopy\fP, so enabling it will always move (and not copy)
files. The \fB\-c\fP switch to the \fBbeet import\fP command, however, still takes
precedence.
.SS link
.sp
Either \fByes\fP or \fBno\fP, indicating whether to use symbolic links instead of
moving or copying files. (It conflicts with the \fBmove\fP, \fBcopy\fP and
\fBhardlink\fP options.) Defaults to \fBno\fP\&.
.sp
This option only works on platforms that support symbolic links: i.e., Unixes.
It will fail on Windows.
.sp
It’s likely that you’ll also want to set \fBwrite\fP to \fBno\fP if you use this
option to preserve the metadata on the linked files.
.SS hardlink
.sp
Either \fByes\fP or \fBno\fP, indicating whether to use hard links instead of
moving, copying, or symlinking files. (It conflicts with the \fBmove\fP, \fBcopy\fP,
and \fBlink\fP options.) Defaults to \fBno\fP\&.
.sp
As with symbolic links (see \fI\%link\fP, above), this will not work on Windows
and you will want to set \fBwrite\fP to \fBno\fP\&. Otherwise, metadata on the
original file will be modified.
.SS reflink
.sp
Either \fByes\fP, \fBno\fP, or \fBauto\fP, indicating whether to use copy\-on\-write
\X'tty: link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write'\fI\%file clones\fP\X'tty: link' (a.k.a. “reflinks”) instead of copying or moving files. The
\fBauto\fP option uses reflinks when possible and falls back to plain copying when
necessary. Defaults to \fBno\fP\&.
.sp
This kind of clone is only available on certain filesystems: for example, btrfs
and APFS. For more details on filesystem support, see the \X'tty: link https://reflink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/'\fI\%pyreflink\fP\X'tty: link'
documentation. Note that you need to install \fBpyreflink\fP, either through
\fBpython \-m pip install beets[reflink]\fP or \fBpython \-m pip install reflink\fP\&.
.sp
The option is ignored if \fBmove\fP is enabled (i.e., beets can move or copy files
but it doesn’t make sense to do both).
.SS resume
.sp
Either \fByes\fP, \fBno\fP, or \fBask\fP\&. Controls whether interrupted imports should
be resumed. “Yes” means that imports are always resumed when possible; “no”
means resuming is disabled entirely; “ask” (the default) means that the user
should be prompted when resuming is possible. The \fB\-p\fP and \fB\-P\fP flags
correspond to the “yes” and “no” settings and override this option.
.SS incremental
.sp
Either \fByes\fP or \fBno\fP, controlling whether imported directories are recorded
and whether these recorded directories are skipped. This corresponds to the
\fB\-i\fP flag to \fBbeet import\fP\&.
.SS incremental_skip_later
.sp
Either \fByes\fP or \fBno\fP, controlling whether skipped directories are recorded
in the incremental list. When set to \fByes\fP, skipped directories won’t be
recorded, and beets will try to import them again later. When set to \fBno\fP,
skipped directories will be recorded, and skipped later. Defaults to \fBno\fP\&.
.SS from_scratch
.sp
Either \fByes\fP or \fBno\fP (default), controlling whether existing metadata is
discarded when a match is applied. This corresponds to the \fB\-\-from\-scratch\fP
flag to \fBbeet import\fP\&.
.SS quiet
.sp
Either \fByes\fP or \fBno\fP (default), controlling whether to ask for a manual
decision from the user when the importer is unsure how to proceed. This
corresponds to the \fB\-\-quiet\fP flag to \fBbeet import\fP\&.
.SS quiet_fallback
.sp
Either \fBskip\fP (default) or \fBasis\fP, specifying what should happen in quiet
mode (see the \fB\-q\fP flag to \fBimport\fP, above) when there is no strong
recommendation.
.SS none_rec_action
.sp
Either \fBask\fP (default), \fBasis\fP or \fBskip\fP\&. Specifies what should happen
during an interactive import session when there is no recommendation. Useful
when you are only interested in processing medium and strong recommendations
interactively.
.SS timid
.sp
Either \fByes\fP or \fBno\fP, controlling whether the importer runs in \fItimid\fP mode,
in which it asks for confirmation on every autotagging match, even the ones that
seem very close. Defaults to \fBno\fP\&. The \fB\-t\fP command\-line flag controls the
same setting.
.SS log
.sp
Specifies a filename where the importer’s log should be kept. By default, no log
is written. This can be overridden with the \fB\-l\fP flag to \fBimport\fP\&.
.SS default_action
.sp
One of \fBapply\fP, \fBskip\fP, \fBasis\fP, or \fBnone\fP, indicating which option
should be the \fIdefault\fP when selecting an action for a given match. This is the
action that will be taken when you type return without an option letter. The
default is \fBapply\fP\&.
.SS languages
.sp
A list of locale names to search for preferred aliases. For example, setting
this to \fBen\fP uses the transliterated artist name “Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky”
instead of the Cyrillic script for the composer’s name when tagging from
MusicBrainz. You can use a space\-separated list of language abbreviations, like
\fBen jp es\fP, to specify a preference order. Defaults to an empty list, meaning
that no language is preferred.
.SS ignored_alias_types
.sp
A list of alias types to be ignored when importing new items.
.sp
See the \fBMusicBrainz Documentation\fP for more information on aliases.
.sp
\&.._MusicBrainz Documentation: \X'tty: link https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Aliases'\fI\%https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Aliases\fP\X'tty: link'
.SS detail
.sp
Whether the importer UI should show detailed information about each match it
finds. When enabled, this mode prints out the title of every track, regardless
of whether it matches the original metadata. (The default behavior only shows
changes.) Default: \fBno\fP\&.
.SS group_albums
.sp
By default, the beets importer groups tracks into albums based on the
directories they reside in. This option instead uses files’ metadata to
partition albums. Enable this option if you have directories that contain tracks
from many albums mixed together.
.sp
The \fB\-\-group\-albums\fP or \fB\-g\fP option to the \fI\%import\fP command is
equivalent, and the \fIG\fP interactive option invokes the same workflow.
.sp
Default: \fBno\fP\&.
.SS autotag
.sp
By default, the beets importer always attempts to autotag new music. If most of
your collection consists of obscure music, you may be interested in disabling
autotagging by setting this option to \fBno\fP\&. (You can re\-enable it with the
\fB\-a\fP flag to the \fI\%import\fP command.)
.sp
Default: \fByes\fP\&.
.SS duplicate_keys
.sp
The fields used to find duplicates when importing. There are two sub\-values
here: \fBalbum\fP and \fBitem\fP\&. Each one is a list of field names; if an existing
object (album or item) in the library matches the new object on all of these
fields, the importer will consider it a duplicate.
.sp
Default:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
album: albumartist album
item: artist title
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS duplicate_action
.sp
Either \fBskip\fP, \fBkeep\fP, \fBremove\fP, \fBmerge\fP or \fBask\fP\&. Controls how
duplicates are treated in import task. “skip” means that new item(album or
track) will be skipped; “keep” means keep both old and new items; “remove” means
remove old item; “merge” means merge into one album; “ask” means the user should
be prompted for the action each time. The default is \fBask\fP\&.
.SS duplicate_verbose_prompt
.sp
Usually when duplicates are detected during import, information about the
existing and the newly imported album is summarized. Enabling this option also
lists details on individual tracks. The \fI\%format_item setting\fP
is applied, which would, considering the default, look like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
This item is already in the library!
Old: 1 items, MP3, 320kbps, 5:56, 13.6 MiB
  Artist Name \- Album Name \- Third Track Title
New: 2 items, MP3, 320kbps, 7:18, 17.1 MiB
  Artist Name \- Album Name \- First Track Title
  Artist Name \- Album Name \- Second Track Title
[S]kip new, Keep all, Remove old, Merge all?
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Default: \fBno\fP\&.
.SS bell
.sp
Ring the terminal bell to get your attention when the importer needs your input.
.sp
Default: \fBno\fP\&.
.SS set_fields
.sp
A dictionary indicating fields to set to values for newly imported music. Here’s
an example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set_fields:
    genre: \(aqTo Listen\(aq
    collection: \(aqUnordered\(aq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Other field/value pairs supplied via the \fB\-\-set\fP option on the command\-line
override any settings here for fields with the same name.
.sp
Values support the same template syntax as beets’ \fI\%path formats\fP\&.
.sp
Fields are set on both the album and each individual track of the album. Fields
are persisted to the media files of each track.
.sp
Default: \fB{}\fP (empty).
.SS singleton_album_disambig
.sp
During singleton imports and if the metadata source provides it, album names are
appended to the disambiguation string of matching track candidates. For example:
\fBThe Artist \- The Title (Discogs, Index 3, Track B1, [The Album]\fP\&. This
feature is currently supported by the \fI\%Discogs Plugin\fP and the
\fI\%Spotify Plugin\fP\&.
.sp
Default: \fByes\fP\&.
.SH AUTOTAGGER MATCHING OPTIONS
.sp
You can configure some aspects of the logic beets uses when automatically
matching MusicBrainz results under the \fBmatch:\fP section. To control how
\fItolerant\fP the autotagger is of differences, use the \fBstrong_rec_thresh\fP
option, which reflects the distance threshold below which beets will make a
“strong recommendation” that the metadata be used. Strong recommendations are
accepted automatically (except in “timid” mode), so you can use this to make
beets ask your opinion more or less often.
.sp
The threshold is a \fIdistance\fP value between 0.0 and 1.0, so you can think of it
as the opposite of a \fIsimilarity\fP value. For example, if you want to
automatically accept any matches above 90% similarity, use:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
match:
    strong_rec_thresh: 0.10
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The default strong recommendation threshold is 0.04.
.sp
The \fBmedium_rec_thresh\fP and \fBrec_gap_thresh\fP options work similarly. When a
match is below the \fImedium\fP recommendation threshold or the distance between it
and the next\-best match is above the \fIgap\fP threshold, the importer will suggest
that match but not automatically confirm it. Otherwise, you’ll see a list of
options to choose from.
.SS max_rec
.sp
As mentioned above, autotagger matches have \fIrecommendations\fP that control how
the UI behaves for a certain quality of match. The recommendation for a certain
match is based on the overall distance calculation. But you can also control the
recommendation when a specific distance penalty is applied by defining \fImaximum\fP
recommendations for each field:
.sp
To define maxima, use keys under \fBmax_rec:\fP in the \fBmatch\fP section. The
defaults are “medium” for missing and unmatched tracks and “strong” (i.e., no
maximum) for everything else:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
match:
    max_rec:
        missing_tracks: medium
        unmatched_tracks: medium
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If a recommendation is higher than the configured maximum and the indicated
penalty is applied, the recommendation is downgraded. The setting for each field
can be one of \fBnone\fP, \fBlow\fP, \fBmedium\fP or \fBstrong\fP\&. When the maximum
recommendation is \fBstrong\fP, no “downgrading” occurs. The available penalty
names here are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2

.IP \(bu 2

.IP \(bu 2
track_id
.UNINDENT
.SS preferred
.sp
In addition to comparing the tagged metadata with the match metadata for
similarity, you can also specify an ordered list of preferred countries and
media types.
.sp
A distance penalty will be applied if the country or media type from the match
metadata doesn’t match. The specified values are preferred in descending order
(i.e., the first item will be most preferred). Each item may be a regular
expression, and will be matched case insensitively. The number of media will be
stripped when matching preferred media (e.g. “2x” in “2xCD”).
.sp
You can also tell the autotagger to prefer matches that have a release year
closest to the original year for an album.
.sp
Here’s an example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
match:
    preferred:
        countries: [\(aqUS\(aq, \(aqGB|UK\(aq]
        media: [\(aqCD\(aq, \(aqDigital Media|File\(aq]
        original_year: yes
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
By default, none of these options are enabled.
.SS ignored
.sp
You can completely avoid matches that have certain penalties applied by adding
the penalty name to the \fBignored\fP setting:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
match:
    ignored: missing_tracks unmatched_tracks
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The available penalties are the same as those for the \fI\%max_rec\fP setting.
.sp
For example, setting \fBignored: missing_tracks\fP will skip any album matches
where your audio files are missing some of the tracks. The importer will not
attempt to display these matches. It does not ignore the fact that the album is
missing tracks, which would allow these matches to apply more easily. To do
that, you’ll want to adjust the penalty for missing tracks.
.SS required
.sp
You can avoid matches that lack certain required information. Add the tags you
want to enforce to the \fBrequired\fP setting:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
match:
    required: year label catalognum country
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
No tags are required by default.
.SS ignored_media
.sp
A list of media (i.e., formats) in metadata databases to ignore when matching
music. You can use this to ignore all media that usually contain video instead
of audio, for example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
match:
    ignored_media: [\(aqData CD\(aq, \(aqDVD\(aq, \(aqDVD\-Video\(aq, \(aqBlu\-ray\(aq, \(aqHD\-DVD\(aq,
                    \(aqVCD\(aq, \(aqSVCD\(aq, \(aqUMD\(aq, \(aqVHS\(aq]
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
No formats are ignored by default.
.SS ignore_data_tracks
.sp
By default, audio files contained in data tracks within a release are included
in the album’s tracklist. If you want them to be included, set it \fBno\fP\&.
.sp
Default: \fByes\fP\&.
.SS ignore_video_tracks
.sp
By default, video tracks within a release will be ignored. If you want them to
be included (for example if you would like to track the audio\-only versions of
the video tracks), set it to \fBno\fP\&.
.sp
Default: \fByes\fP\&.
.SH PATH FORMAT CONFIGURATION
.sp
You can also configure the directory hierarchy beets uses to store music. These
settings appear under the \fBpaths:\fP key. Each string is a template string that
can refer to metadata fields like \fB$artist\fP or \fB$title\fP\&. The filename
extension is added automatically. At the moment, you can specify three special
paths: \fBdefault\fP for most releases, \fBcomp\fP for “various artist” releases
with no dominant artist, and \fBsingleton\fP for non\-album tracks. The defaults
look like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
paths:
    default: $albumartist/$album%aunique{}/$track $title
    singleton: Non\-Album/$artist/$title
    comp: Compilations/$album%aunique{}/$track $title
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note the use of \fB$albumartist\fP instead of \fB$artist\fP; this ensures that
albums will be well\-organized. For more about these format strings, see
\fI\%Path Formats\fP\&. The \fBaunique{}\fP function ensures that identically\-named
albums are placed in different directories; see \fI\%Album Disambiguation\fP for details.
.sp
In addition to \fBdefault\fP, \fBcomp\fP, and \fBsingleton\fP, you can condition path
queries based on beets queries (see \fI\%Queries\fP). This means that a
config file like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
paths:
    albumtype:soundtrack: Soundtracks/$album/$track $title
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
will place soundtrack albums in a separate directory. The queries are tested in
the order they appear in the configuration file, meaning that if an item matches
multiple queries, beets will use the path format for the \fIfirst\fP matching query.
.sp
Note that the special \fBsingleton\fP and \fBcomp\fP path format conditions are, in
fact, just shorthand for the explicit queries \fBsingleton:true\fP and
\fBcomp:true\fP\&. In contrast, \fBdefault\fP is special and has no query equivalent:
the \fBdefault\fP format is only used if no queries match.
.SH CONFIGURATION LOCATION
.sp
The beets configuration file is usually located in a standard location that
depends on your OS, but there are a couple of ways you can tell beets where to
look.
.SS Environment Variable
.sp
First, you can set the \fBBEETSDIR\fP environment variable to a directory
containing a \fBconfig.yaml\fP file. This replaces your configuration in the
default location. This also affects where auxiliary files, like the library
database, are stored by default (that’s where relative paths are resolved to).
This environment variable is useful if you need to manage multiple beets
libraries with separate configurations.
.SS Command\-Line Option
.sp
Alternatively, you can use the \fB\-\-config\fP command\-line option to indicate a
YAML file containing options that will then be merged with your existing options
(from \fBBEETSDIR\fP or the default locations). This is useful if you want to keep
your configuration mostly the same but modify a few options as a batch. For
example, you might have different strategies for importing files, each with a
different set of importer options.
.SS Default Location
.sp
In the absence of a \fBBEETSDIR\fP variable, beets searches a few places for your
configuration, depending on the platform:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
On Unix platforms, including OS X:\fB~/.config/beets\fP and then
\fB$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/beets\fP, if the environment variable is set.
.IP \(bu 2
On OS X, we also search \fB~/Library/Application Support/beets\fP before the
Unixy locations.
.IP \(bu 2
On Windows: \fB~\eAppData\eRoaming\ebeets\fP, and then \fB%APPDATA%\ebeets\fP, if the
environment variable is set.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Beets uses the first directory in your platform’s list that contains
\fBconfig.yaml\fP\&. If no config file exists, the last path in the list is used.
.SH EXAMPLE
