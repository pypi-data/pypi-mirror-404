## Fetch Data (`get`)

Downloads latest data from IBKR and syncs exchange rates from NBS (National Bank of Serbia).

Saves them to local storage.

```bash
ibkr-porez get
```

## Import Historical Data (`import`)

Loading transaction history older than 365 days, which cannot be retrieved via Flex Query (`get`).

1.  Download CSV: [Export Full History](ibkr.md/#export-full-history-for-import-command)
2.  Import file:

```bash
ibkr-porez import /path/to/activity_statement.csv
```

> ⚠️ Do not forget to run `get` after `import` so the application adds maximum details at least for the last year
> into the less detailed data loaded from CSV.

### Synchronization Logic (`import` + `get`)
When loading data from CSV (`import`) and Flex Query (`get`), the system prioritizes more complete Flex Query data:

*   Flex Query (`get`) data is the source of truth. It overwrites CSV data for any matching dates.
*   If a Flex Query record matches a CSV record semantically (Date, Ticker, Price, Quantity), it counts as an update (replacing with official ID).
*   If data structure differs (e.g. split orders in Flex Query vs "bundled" record in CSV), the old CSV record is removed, and new Flex Query records are added.
*   Completely identical records are skipped.

## Show Statistics (`show`)

```bash
ibkr-porez show
```

Shows:

*   Dividends received (in RSD).
*   Number of sales (taxable events).
*   Estimated Realized P/L (Capital Gains) (in RSD).

## Generate Capital Gains Tax Report (`report`)

```bash
# Report for the last full half-year
ibkr-porez report

# Report for the second half of 2025 (Jul 1 - Dec 31)
ibkr-porez report --year 2025 --half 2
```

* **Output**: `ppdg3r_2025_H1.xml`
* Import this file into the Serbian Tax Administration portal (ePorezi)
* Manually upload the file from [Confirmation Document](ibkr.md#confirmation-document) to Item 8
