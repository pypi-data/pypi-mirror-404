## [2026.01.22] - 2026-01-22

### 🔧 Improved
- **provider**: webscout/Provider/Deepinfra.py & webscout/Provider/OPENAI/deepinfra.py - Enhanced model filtering:
  - Updated `get_models()` to only fetch and return model IDs that have complete metadata with both `context_length` and `max_tokens` fields
  - Ensures only production-ready, well-documented models are available in the model list
  - Both native and OpenAI-compatible providers now implement consistent filtering logic
  - Fallback to `AVAILABLE_MODELS` list when API fetch fails or no complete models are found

### 🐛 Fixed
- **fix**: webscout/server/server.py - Fixed critical webscout-server startup failure when running in production mode (debug=False, workers=1). The issue was a missing `else` clause in the `run_api()` function's uvicorn configuration logic, causing the server to never start when using default settings.

### ✅ Quality
- All ruff linting checks passed successfully on modified files
- All type checking with `ty` passed successfully

## [2026.01.19] - 2026-01-19

### 🔧 Improved
- **provider**: webscout/Provider/Ayle.py - Reverse engineered ayle.chat to update available models and configs:
  - Added support for 11 verified working models including Gemini 2.5 Flash, Grok-based models, and Sonar.
  - Implemented a test suite to verify 31 discovered models, removing 20 non-functional ones.
  - Verified no authentication is required and streaming is fully supported.
  - Updated `AVAILABLE_MODELS` and `MODEL_CONFIGS` with the optimized list.

## [2026.01.17] - 2026-01-17

  - Removed Phoenix WebSocket complexity and unused `cache_find()` helper function
  - Simplified API flow to single GET request to `/q` endpoint with mode and detail_level parameters
  - Added `_extract_answer()` method to parse HTML response and extract answer from `div#id="text"`
  - Added `_iter_chunks()` method for improved chunked streaming (800-char chunks with word boundaries)
  - Removed unnecessary `aiohttp` WebSocket dependency, simplified async implementation
  - Updated endpoints: `api_endpoint` to `https://iask.ai`, new `query_endpoint` to `https://iask.ai/q`
  - **Integrated LitAgent** for realistic User-Agent header generation (replaced hardcoded static user agent)
  - Both streaming and non-streaming modes now use consistent `fetch_answer()` async flow
  - Performance: Reduced request overhead and latency by eliminating WebSocket handshake

### 🐛 Fixed

### � Fixed
- **fix**: webscout/Provider/OPENAI/sonus.py - Fixed critical non-stream request error "stream mode is not enabled":
  - Root cause: SonusAI API returns a streaming response even for non-stream requests
  - Solution: Added `stream=True` parameter to the `session.post()` call in `_create_non_stream()` method
  - Impact: Non-streaming chat completions now work correctly with the OpenAI-compatible SonusAI provider

### 📝 Documentation
- **docs**: webscout/client.py - Generated comprehensive PEP 257-compliant docstrings for all 32+ classes and methods:

- **remove**: Updated `webscout/Provider/AISEARCH/__init__.py` to remove Genspark import and export
- **remove**: Updated documentation in `webscout/Provider/AISEARCH/README.md` and `Provider.md` to reflect removal of Genspark provider

### 🔧 Maintenance
- **refactor**: webscout/Provider/AISEARCH/monica_search.py - Simplified streaming content extraction by switching to an inline lambda for `sanitize_stream`'s `content_extractor` that returns `chunk["text"]` when present. Removed the now-unused `_extract_monica_content` method. Note: this change intentionally stops persisting `session_id` from stream payloads; reintroduce session handling if session persistence is required.
- **fix**: webscout/Provider/AISEARCH/webpilotai_search.py - Use `sanitize_stream`'s `content_extractor` for both streaming and non-streaming flows to parse JSON payloads and return the nested `content` (fallbacks to `text` and `data.delta.content` where present). This aligns behavior with `monica_search` and prevents empty or incomplete output when the service emits nested or delta-based content. Raw mode still returns unprocessed chunks.
- **fix**: webscout/Provider/AISEARCH/PERPLEXED_search.py - Fixed critical streaming issues and standardized with other providers:
  - Replaced manual JSON parsing with `sanitize_stream` using `line_delimiter="[/PERPLEXED-SEPARATOR]"` parameter
  - Fixed streaming generator that was not yielding chunks due to incorrect delimiter handling
  - Updated both streaming and non-streaming modes to use consistent `sanitize_stream` configuration
  - Improved content extraction logic to properly handle answer fields from JSON responses
  - Fixed `if __name__ == "__main__"` block to properly consume and display streaming responses
  - Now follows same pattern as webpilotai, miromind, and monica providers for consistency

## [2026.01.01] - 2026-01-01

### 🚮 Removed

- **fix**: Fixed ModuleNotFoundError for huggingface_hub in webscout versions > 2025.12.19 by implementing lazy imports in gguf.py
  - Replaced unconditional `from huggingface_hub import HfApi` with lazy import pattern
  - Added `_ensure_huggingface_hub()` function that imports HfApi only when GGUF features are used
  - Updated all HfApi usage in ModelConverter class to use lazy imports
  - This fixes import issues for users who only need chat/LLM provider features without GGUF conversion
  - Provides clear error message when GGUF features are used without huggingface_hub installed

### ✨ Added
- **remove**: Removed HadadXYZ providers: `webscout/Provider/HadadXYZ.py` and `webscout/Provider/OPENAI/hadadxyz.py`. These implementations are deprecated and removed to streamline provider maintenance.

    - Moved module-level imports to the top of files in `server` and `aihumanizer`.
    - Replaced incorrect type comparisons (e.g., `== bool`) with idiomatic `is bool`.
    - Split multiple statements on single lines (E701, E702) across the entire project for better readability.
- **refactor**: Replaced star imports (`from ... import *`) with explicit imports in `GitToolkit` and `samurai` provider to eliminate name shadowing and improve static analysis.
- **refactor**: Added dynamic model fetching to both DeepInfra providers (`webscout/Provider/Deepinfra.py`, `webscout/Provider/OPENAI/deepinfra.py`) following Groq provider pattern. Implemented `get_models()` and `update_available_models()` class methods that fetch from `https://api.deepinfra.com/v1/models` API endpoint with fallback to default models on failure. Providers now automatically update their available models list during initialization.
