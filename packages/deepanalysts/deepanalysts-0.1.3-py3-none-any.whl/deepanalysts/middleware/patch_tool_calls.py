"""Middleware to patch dangling tool calls in the messages history.

This middleware handles cases where an AIMessage has tool calls but no corresponding
ToolMessage responses. This can happen when:
- The agent is interrupted before completing a tool call
- An error occurs during tool execution
- A message comes in before tool calls complete

Without this middleware, dangling tool calls can cause API errors since most LLM
APIs require tool calls to have corresponding tool messages.
