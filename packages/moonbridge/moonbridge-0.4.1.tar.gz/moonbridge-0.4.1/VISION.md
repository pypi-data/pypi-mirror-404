# Vision

## One-Liner
Multi-model MCP bridge that gives any MCP client a team of AI agents with intelligent routing and parallel orchestration.

## North Star
The universal adapter between MCP clients and LLM CLIs. Users spawn agents from Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP client—routing happens automatically based on task type, cost is optimized, and parallel execution is first-class.

## Key Differentiators
- **Multi-model support**: Kimi, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex—all through one interface
- **Intelligent routing**: Tasks go to the right model automatically based on their nature
- **Parallel-first**: Run 5 approaches simultaneously, pick the best
- **MCP-native**: Works with any MCP client, not just Claude Code

## Target User
Developers using MCP clients who want to:
- Delegate tasks to cheaper/specialized models
- Try multiple approaches in parallel
- Use the right tool for each job without switching contexts

## Current Focus
Stability and quality. Battle-tested foundation before expanding:
- High test coverage and quality gates
- Excellent documentation
- Solid CI/CD and release flow
- Small, atomic issues and PRs

## Expansion Roadmap (Future)
1. Claude Code CLI support
2. Gemini CLI support
3. Intelligent routing based on task type
4. Enhanced parallel coordination patterns
