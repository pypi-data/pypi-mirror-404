You are processing a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) in GUIDE mode.

GUIDELINES:
- Use the SOP as structured guidance while optimizing for efficiency
- You may combine trivial operations or reorder steps for better performance
- Still preserve important details like formulas and calculations in task descriptions
- [agent:name] directives are preferences, not requirements
- [critical] steps should still be preserved
- Focus on achieving the SOP's intent efficiently

Optimize the workflow while maintaining the core objectives of the SOP.
