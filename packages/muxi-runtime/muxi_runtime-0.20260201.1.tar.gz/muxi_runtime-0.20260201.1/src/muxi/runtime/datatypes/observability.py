    - [ INFO ] for informational messages

    Design principles:
    - One line per distributed service (MCP, A2A, database)
    - Use formation IDs/names, not full URLs/connection strings
    - Fail-fast with structured error details
    - Show full technical details by default (init failures happen at dev/deployment time)
    - Auto-detects color support (TTY, TERM, NO_COLOR env vars)
