{% if stage_name %}
Current stage: {{ stage_name }}.
Return JSON with keys: {{ stage_fields | join(", ") }}.
Output language: {{ output_language }}. Use that language in all answers (if zh, use Chinese).
Previously completed outputs (JSON): {{ previous_outputs }}
{% else %}
Answer each question in the corresponding JSON field question1 through question8.
Use Markdown in each answer if helpful.
Output language: {{ output_language }}. Use that language in all answers (if zh, use Chinese).

Diagram guidance (only when relevant; do not invent):
- In question3, include a mermaid architecture diagram when the paper describes system/model architecture or algorithm flow.
- Triggers: "architecture", "module", "pipeline", "stage", "system", "flow" or explicit block/module descriptions.
{% endif %}

Questions:
1) What problem does the paper try to solve?
2) What related research exists? (separate: strongest baseline, closest approach, orthogonal directions)
3) How does the paper solve the problem? (include a text flowchart)
4) What datasets and implementation settings are used? Why these datasets/scenarios, and which key properties do they validate?
5) What are the metrics and results? List metrics, summarize results, and explain which innovation each metric reflects.
6) What can be further explored? (split by theory/engineering/data/evaluation)
7) How would this work in real-world scenarios? (deployment constraints, compute, latency, robustness)
8) Summarize the main content (one paragraph + 5 bullets + one core formula/mechanism)
