Template: three_pass

{% if stage_name %}
Current stage: {{ stage_name }}.
Return JSON with keys: {{ stage_fields | join(", ") }}.
Output language: {{ output_language }}. Use that language in all answers (if zh, use Chinese).
Previously completed outputs (JSON): {{ previous_outputs }}
{% else %}
Follow the three-pass reading method. Fill the JSON fields:
- step1_summary: "Step 1" output (overview + innovation highlights + structure + figures + conclusion + references + open source).
- step2_analysis: "Step 2" output (content comprehension + experiments + evidence + related work weaknesses).
- step3_analysis: "Step 3" output (reconstruction, assumptions, failure modes, strengths/weaknesses, future work).
Use Markdown inside each field to format lists and sections.
Output language: {{ output_language }}. Use that language in all answers (if zh, use Chinese).

Step 1 guidance:
- Summarize title/abstract/introduction.
- List 3-5 innovations.
- List authors and affiliations if available.
- List section and subsection titles (translated if needed).
- Summarize key figures/tables.
- Summarize conclusions.
- List key references.
- State whether code is open-sourced and where.

Step 2 guidance:
- Explain each innovation: source, prior limitations, and solution details.
- Analyze experiments: datasets, objectives, baselines, results, ablations.
- Analyze key figures/tables.
- Summarize important related work and weaknesses.

Step 3 guidance:
- Provide a reconstruction outline and pseudocode if possible.
- Challenge assumptions and statements.
- Identify failure modes and reasons.
- Assess strengths/weaknesses and possible fixes.
- Suggest future research directions.
