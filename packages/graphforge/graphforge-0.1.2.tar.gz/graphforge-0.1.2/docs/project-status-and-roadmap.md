- ✅ Faster development
- ✅ Battle-tested
- ❌ External dependency
- **Recommendation:** `pyparsing` or `lark-parser`

**Option B:** Write custom parser
- ✅ Full control
- ✅ No dependencies
- ❌ Time-consuming
- ❌ More bugs initially

**Recommended:** Start with Option A (pyparsing/lark), can replace later

```python

- validator.py         # Validate AST for v1 subset
```

**Tests:** `tests/unit/parser/test_parser.py`
- Parse valid queries
- Reject invalid syntax
- Error messages for unsupported features
- TCK parsing scenarios

**Milestone:** Can parse v1 Cypher queries into validated AST

---

### Phase 3: Logical Plan & Execution (Week 5-6)
**Goal:** Execute queries against in-memory graphs

#### 3.1 Logical Plan (`src/graphforge/planner/`)
```python
- operators.py     # ScanNodes, ExpandEdges, Filter, Project, Limit
- planner.py       # AST → Logical Plan
- optimizer.py     # Basic rule-based optimization (optional)
```

**Tests:** `tests/unit/planner/test_planner.py`

#### 3.3 Python API (`src/graphforge/api.py`)
```python
class GraphForge:
    def __init__(self, path: str | Path): ...
    def execute(self, query: str) -> ResultSet: ...
    def close(self): ...
```

**Tests:** `tests/integration/test_api.py`
- End-to-end query execution
- Result format validation
- Error handling

**Milestone:** Can execute full v1 queries end-to-end (in-memory only)

---

### Phase 4: TCK Compliance (Week 7-8)
**Goal:** Pass openCypher TCK tests for v1 features

#### 4.1 TCK Integration (`tests/tck/`)
```python
- utils/tck_runner.py       # TCK scenario executor
- features/match/           # Match tests

- features/return/          # Return tests
```

#### 4.2 Fix Semantic Issues
- Debug TCK failures
- Fix semantic mismatches
- Update coverage matrix

**Tests:** `tests/tck/features/**/*.py`
- Run TCK scenarios
- Validate semantic correctness

**Milestone:** Pass all v1 TCK tests, coverage matrix shows "supported" status

---

### Phase 5: Persistence Layer (Week 9-10)
**Goal:** Durable storage with ACID properties using SQLite

#### 5.1 Architecture Decision: SQLite

**Decision:** Use SQLite as the storage backend (see `docs/storage-architecture-analysis.md`)

**Rationale:**
- Provides ACID, WAL mode, crash recovery out-of-the-box
- Battle-tested (20+ years, billions of deployments)
- Zero operational overhead (embedded, zero-config)
- Aligns with "mirrors SQLite" design philosophy
- 20-30 hours implementation vs 120-175 hours for custom WAL
- Allows focus on openCypher features

#### 5.2 Storage Implementation (`src/graphforge/storage/`)
```python
- backend.py        # Storage backend interface (Protocol)
- sqlite_backend.py # SQLite implementation (default)
- schema.py         # Graph-specific SQLite schema
- serialization.py  # CypherValue <-> bytes conversion
```

**SQLite Schema Design:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE nodes (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    labels BLOB,      -- MessagePack serialized set
    properties BLOB   -- MessagePack serialized dict
);

CREATE TABLE edges (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    type TEXT,
    src_id INTEGER,
    dst_id INTEGER,
    properties BLOB,
    FOREIGN KEY (src_id) REFERENCES nodes(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (dst_id) REFERENCES nodes(id)
);

CREATE TABLE adjacency_out (
    node_id INTEGER,
    edge_id INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (node_id, edge_id)
);

CREATE TABLE adjacency_in (
    node_id INTEGER,
    edge_id INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (node_id, edge_id)
);

-- Indexes for fast lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_nodes_labels ON nodes(labels);
CREATE INDEX idx_edges_type ON edges(type);
CREATE INDEX idx_edges_src ON edges(src_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_edges_dst ON edges(dst_id);
```

**SQLite Configuration:**
```python
PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;  # Single writer, multiple readers
PRAGMA synchronous=FULL;   # Durability guarantee
PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON;    # Referential integrity
```

**Tests:** `tests/integration/test_storage.py`
- Persist and reload graphs
- Transaction isolation (BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK)
- Crash recovery simulation
- Concurrent readers (multiple connections)
- ID stability across restarts

**Milestone:** Graphs persist across restarts, ACID guarantees, zero-config

---

### Phase 6: Polish & Documentation (Week 11-12)
**Goal:** Production-ready v1 release

#### 6.1 Query Plan Inspection
```python
- plan_formatter.py    # Human-readable plan output
- GraphForge.explain(query) → formatted plan
```

#### 6.2 Performance Testing
```python
tests/benchmarks/
- benchmark_parsing.py
- benchmark_execution.py
- benchmark_storage.py
```

#### 6.3 Documentation
- API documentation with examples
- Tutorial notebook
- Migration guide (NetworkX → GraphForge)
- Performance characteristics

#### 6.4 Error Messages
- Improve parser error messages
- Add query execution hints
- Document error codes

**Milestone:** v1.0.0 release ready

---

## Immediate Next Steps (Phase 4: TCK Compliance)

With Phase 3 complete and a working query engine, the next priority is TCK (Technology Compatibility Kit) compliance testing.

### Priority 1: Add Missing Features for TCK

Based on current limitations identified in Phase 3:

1. **RETURN Aliasing** - `RETURN n.name AS name`
   - Update ReturnClause AST to include aliases
   - Update parser to parse AS keyword
   - Update Project operator to use aliases in output

2. **ORDER BY Clause**
   - Add OrderByClause to AST
   - Add Sort operator to planner
   - Implement _execute_sort in executor

3. **Aggregation Functions**
   - Add FunctionCall expression to AST
   - Implement COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX()
   - Handle aggregation in planner (GroupBy operator)

4. **Multiple Labels in WHERE**
   - Update ScanNodes to handle multiple labels correctly
   - Fix label index queries to support multi-label nodes

### Priority 2: Set Up openCypher TCK

1. **Clone TCK repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher.git vendor/opencypher
   ```

2. **Create TCK test runner** - `tests/tck/utils/tck_runner.py`
   - Parse Gherkin feature files
   - Execute scenarios against GraphForge
   - Report pass/fail

3. **Create TCK integration** - `tests/tck/test_tck_features.py`
   - Run selected TCK scenarios
   - Mark expected failures
   - Track coverage

### Priority 3: Fix Semantic Issues

Run TCK tests and fix failures:
- Debug semantic mismatches
- Fix NULL propagation edge cases
- Ensure comparison semantics match spec
- Validate result formats

**Goal:** Pass all TCK tests for v1 features (MATCH, WHERE, RETURN, LIMIT, SKIP)

---

## Development Workflow

### Daily Cycle

1. **Pick a component** from the roadmap
2. **Write tests first** (TDD)
   ```bash
   pytest -m unit --watch
   ```
3. **Implement minimal code** to pass tests
4. **Refactor** while keeping tests green
5. **Check coverage**
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
   ```
6. **Commit**
   ```bash
   ruff format . && ruff check --fix .
   git add . && git commit -m "Add NodeRef implementation"
   ```

### Weekly Cycle

1. **Review progress** against roadmap
2. **Run full test suite** including integration tests
3. **Update TCK coverage matrix** if features were added
4. **Update documentation** if APIs changed
5. **Performance check** - are tests still fast?

---

## Decision Points

### Parser Library Choice

**Recommendation:** Use `lark-parser`

**Rationale:**
- Good performance
- Clear grammar syntax (EBNF)
- Excellent error messages
- Can reference openCypher grammar directly
- Active maintenance

**Alternative:** `pyparsing` if you prefer combinator style

### Storage Backend Choice

**Decision:** Use SQLite (architectural decision finalized)

**Rationale:**
- ACID guarantees out of the box (transactions, WAL, crash recovery)
- Cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Zero configuration (single file, embedded)
- Battle-tested durability (20+ years, billions of deployments)
- Matches "embedded" design goal
- Allows focus on openCypher execution vs storage implementation
- 20-30 hours implementation vs 120-175 hours for custom WAL
- Storage backend is replaceable if future optimization needed

See `docs/storage-architecture-analysis.md` for detailed decision analysis.

### Implementation Style

**Recommendation:** Functional core, imperative shell

**Rationale:**
- Pure functions for AST, planning, execution logic
- Side effects isolated to storage layer
- Easier to test and reason about
- Matches Cypher's declarative nature

---

## Risk Management

### Potential Challenges

1. **Parser complexity**
   - Mitigation: Use existing parser library
   - Fallback: Start with simplified grammar

2. **TCK semantic correctness**
   - Mitigation: Implement TCK tests incrementally
   - Fallback: Clearly document semantic differences

3. **Storage performance**
   - Mitigation: Start simple, optimize later
   - Fallback: Document scaling limits clearly

4. **Scope creep**
   - Mitigation: Strict adherence to v1 scope
