[Langflow](https://langflow.org) is a powerful platform for building and deploying AI-powered agents and workflows. It provides developers with both a visual authoring experience and built-in API and MCP servers that turn every workflow into a tool that can be integrated into applications built on any framework or stack. Langflow comes with batteries included and supports all major LLMs, vector databases and a growing library of AI tools.

## ✨ Highlight features

- **Visual builder interface** to quickly get started and iterate.
- **Source code access** lets you customize any component using Python.
- **Interactive playground** to immediately test and refine your flows with step-by-step control.
- **Multi-agent orchestration** with conversation management and retrieval.
- **Deploy as an API** or export as JSON for Python apps.
- **Deploy as an MCP server** and turn your flows into tools for MCP clients.
- **Observability** with LangSmith, LangFuse and other integrations.
- **Enterprise-ready** security and scalability.

## 🖥️  Langflow Desktop

Langflow Desktop is the easiest way to get started with Langflow. All dependencies are included, so you don't need to manage Python environments or install packages manually.

> [!CAUTION]
> - Users must update to Langflow >= 1.7.1 to protect against [CVE-2025-68477](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/security/advisories/GHSA-5993-7p27-66g5) and [CVE-2025-68478](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/security/advisories/GHSA-f43r-cc68-gpx4).
> - Langflow version 1.7.0 has a critical bug where persisted state (flows, projects, and global variables) cannot be found when upgrading. Version 1.7.0 was yanked and replaced with version 1.7.1, which includes a fix for this bug. **DO NOT** upgrade to version 1.7.0. Instead, upgrade directly to version 1.7.1.
> - Langflow versions 1.6.0 through 1.6.3 have a critical bug where `.env` files are not read, potentially causing security vulnerabilities. **DO NOT** upgrade to these versions if you use `.env` files for configuration. Instead, upgrade to 1.6.4, which includes a fix for this bug.
> - Windows users of Langflow Desktop should **not** use the in-app update feature to upgrade to Langflow version 1.6.0. For upgrade instructions, see [Windows Desktop update issue](https://docs.langflow.org/release-notes#windows-desktop-update-issue).
> - Users must update to Langflow >= 1.3 to protect against [CVE-2025-3248](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-3248)
> - Users must update to Langflow >= 1.5.1 to protect against [CVE-2025-57760](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/security/advisories/GHSA-4gv9-mp8m-592r)
