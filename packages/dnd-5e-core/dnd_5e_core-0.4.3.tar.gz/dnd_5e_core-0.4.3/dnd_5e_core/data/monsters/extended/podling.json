An observer familiar with the digested creature can recognize the discrepancies with a successful {@dc 20} Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check, or automatically if the podling does something in direct contradiction to the digested creature's established beliefs or behavior. The podling melts into a slurry when it dies, when the bodytaker plant that created it dies, or when the bodytaker plant dismisses it (no action required)."
