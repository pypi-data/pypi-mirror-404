        "The harpy sings a magical melody, which lasts until the harpy's {@status Concentration|XPHB} ends on it. {@actSave wis} {@dc 11}, each Humanoid and Giant in a 300-foot {@variantrule Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation} originating from the harpy when the song starts. {@actSaveFail} The target has the {@condition Charmed|XPHB} condition until the song ends and repeats the save at the end of each of its turns. While {@condition Charmed|XPHB}, the target has the {@condition Incapacitated|XPHB} condition and ignores the Luring Song of other harpies. If the target is more than 5 feet from the harpy, the target moves on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet of the harpy. It doesn't avoid {@action Opportunity Attack|XPHB|Opportunity Attacks}; however, before moving into damaging terrain (such as lava or a pit) and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, the target repeats the save. {@actSaveSuccess} The target is immune to this harpy's Luring Song for 24 hours."
