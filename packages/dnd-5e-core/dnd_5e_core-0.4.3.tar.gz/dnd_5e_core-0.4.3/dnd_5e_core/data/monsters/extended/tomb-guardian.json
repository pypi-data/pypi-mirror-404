On each of its turns while berserk, the tomb guardian attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the tomb guardian attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the tomb guardian goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points. The golem's creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk tomb guardian, can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The tomb guardian must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a {@dc 15} Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. If the check succeeds, the tomb guardian ceases being berserk. If it takes damage while still at 40 hit points or fewer, the tomb guardian might go berserk again."
