Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 17} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 31 ({@damage 7d8}) force damage and is magically weakened as it is desynchronized from the time stream. While the creature is in this state, attack rolls against it have advantage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A weakened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself after it succeeds on two of these saves."
