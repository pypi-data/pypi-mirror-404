On a failed save, the target is {@condition poisoned}, which causes it to also gain 1 level of {@condition exhaustion}. While {@condition poisoned} in this way, the target must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. Three successful saves against the poison end it, and ending the poison removes any levels of {@condition exhaustion} caused by it. Each failed save causes the target to gain another level of {@condition exhaustion}. Once the target reaches 6 levels of {@condition exhaustion}, it dies and instantly transforms into a living {@creature manes} under the sibriex's control.
