While encased, the creature doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn't age. Nothing can pass through the orb, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to enter or exit the orb. As a bonus action, the drone can move the orb and its contents up to 30 feet in any direction. A successful casting of the {@spell Dispel Magic} spell on the orb ({@dc 15}) destroys it. The orb otherwise remains intact until the drone spends an action to end the effect or the drone is destroyed. A drone can have only one detention orb active at a time; if the drone creates a detention orb when it already has one active, the first orb disappears, freeing the creature inside."
