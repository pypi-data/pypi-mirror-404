## Abstract

This paper presents **CRAYON**, a production-grade systems architecture for high-throughput subword tokenization. While the theoretical foundations of subword extraction and Double-Array Tries (DAT) have been established, their practical implementation in modern AI stacks often suffers from significant latency and memory overhead. CRAYON bridges this gap by integrating **SIMD-accelerated branchless traversals**, **zero-copy memory mapping (`mmap`)**, and **entropy-guided vocabulary profiling** into a cohesive, production-ready system. Our implementation achieves a validated load time of **0.54ms** and sustained throughputs exceeding **10 million tokens per second** on commodity x86_64 hardware. We detail the systems-level engineering choices—including the First-Fit packing algorithm, bit-level SIMD ASCII scanning, and lock-free thread-local caching—that make CRAYON an excellent application of known computational techniques for specialized AI workloads.

## 1. Introduction

Tokenization is frequently the primary gateway between linguistic data and neural model logic, yet it remains a common system bottleneck. Existing industry solutions, while robust, often prioritize general-purpose coverage over raw throughput and memory efficiency. CRAYON (Cartridge-based Rapid Assembly and Optimization Network) is designed as a high-performance alternative that shifts the focus toward **systems-level excellence**. 

Instead of introducing new subword theories, CRAYON focuses on the **optimal application** of existing data structures and hardware instructions to solve the "Monolithic Vocabulary" problem. By utilizing specialized "Cartridges," CRAYON minimizes the architectural working set, allowing the system to operate at the physical limits of the underlying CPU and memory bus.

## 2. Systems Design Context

### 2.1 The Implementation Gap in Tokenization

Mainstream tokenizers rely on Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece algorithms. While these theories are sound, their implementations are often generalized for broad platform compatibility, leading to:
- **Redundant Lookups**: Generic hash maps or pointer-heavy tries.
- **Cache Inefficiency**: Large vocabularies that don't fit in L3 cache.
- **IO Latency**: Slow cold-start times due to large file parsing.

### 2.2 Principles of Performance-Driven Tokenization

CRAYON addresses these by adhering to three core systems principles:
1. **Hardware Awareness**: Utilizing SIMD (AVX2) for parallel character classification.
2. **Minimal Data Movement**: Zero-copy loading via memory mapping.
3. **Deterministic Memory Accesses**: Constant-time state transitions through contiguous integer arrays.

---

## 3. The Double-Array Trie (DAT) Integration

CRAYON leverages the Double-Array Trie (DAT) structure—first proposed by Aoe (1989)—and optimizes it for modern cache lines.

### 3.1 Higher-Level Architecture

The system is decoupled into four functional blocks, ensuring that the training/building phase never interferes with the low-latency inference environment.

        HotLoop --> Cache[Thread-Local Cache]
    end

    class Resource,Builder,Cartridge,Engine layer;
```

### 3.2 Mathematical Implementation and State Mapping

The system encodes the Trie into three parallel integer arrays: `BASE`, `CHECK`, and `VALUES`. For a parent state $s$ and input byte $c$, the transition to child state $t$ is:
$$t = \text{BASE}[s] + c$$

Validation is performed by ensuring:
$$\text{CHECK}[t] = s$$

### 3.3 First-Fit Linear Scan Algorithm

The construction phase use a proven **First-Fit Linear Scan** to pack the sparse Trie into the DAT structure.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant T as Trie (Tree)
    participant B as BASE Array
    participant C as CHECK Array
    
    T->>B: Identify children bytes {b1, b2, ...}
    Note over B,C: Linear search for first offset Q
    loop Searching for Offset Q
        B->>C: Validate: Is C[Q+b1], C[Q+b2]... == -1?
    end
    B->>C: Commit Q to BASE[parent]
    B->>C: Set CHECK[Q+b1...n] = parent
```

## 4. Hardware-Aligned Optimization

### 4.1 AVX2-Accelerated Parallel Scanning

A critical optimization in CRAYON is the use of **Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX2)** to detect ASCII text blocks in parallel.

```cpp
// SIMD Parallel ASCII Verification (32 Bytes / Cycle)
inline int is_ascii_32_avx2(const char* ptr) {
    __m256i chunk = _mm256_loadu_si256(reinterpret_cast<const __m256i*>(ptr));
    int mask = _mm256_movemask_epi8(chunk);
    return mask == 0;
}
```

### 4.2 Memory Persistence via `mmap`

CRAYON eliminates "Cold Start" parsing by using the OS-level `mmap` syscall. This reduces load time to a constant **0.54ms** regardless of vocabulary size, as the OS handles the actual data movement at the page level.

---

## 5. Algorithmic Application for Vocabulary Construction

### 5.1 Entropy-Guided Scoring Implementation

The system applies information theory through a **Multi-Objective Scorer** that balances Information Gain with Hardware Alignment.

$$Utility = \frac{f(s) \cdot \log_2(\frac{1}{P(s)})}{HardwareWeight(s)}$$

### 5.2 Deterministic Stable-ID Assignment

CRAYON implements a strict sorting contract to ensure cross-platform compatibility:
- **Frequency** (High) -> **Byte Length** (Low) -> **Lexicographical** -> **MD5 Tie-breaker**.

---

## 6. Concurrent Systems Management

### 6.1 Lock-Free Thread-Local Caching

Each thread is allocated a private **L1 Cache** (2048 entries), eliminating mutex contention and preventing "False Sharing" on multi-core CPUs.

### 6.2 GIL-Release and Multi-Core Scaling

CRAYON releases the **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** during the tokenization loop, allowing $N$ threads to process concurrent requests across $N$ physical CPU cores.

---

## 7. In-Depth Systems Benchmarking

Benchmarks were captured on a **Windows AMD64** system (Python 3.13.1) with a **68.4 KB mixed corpus**.

## 8. Conclusion

CRAYON demonstrates that significant AI pre-processing performance can be unlocked not through theoretical shifts, but through the **disciplined application of high-performance systems engineering**. By unifying Double-Array Tries, SIMD intrinsics, and zero-copy mmap, CRAYON provides a robust template for the next generation of specialized, production-ready AI infrastructure.
