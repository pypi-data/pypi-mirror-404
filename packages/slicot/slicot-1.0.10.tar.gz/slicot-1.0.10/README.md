Python bindings for **SLICOT** (Subroutine Library In COntrol Theory) - numerical routines for control systems analysis and design. This is a low-level API primarily targeting AI agents and higher-level libraries.

## Installation

```bash
pip install slicot
```

## Features

- **600+ routines** for control systems
- **State-space methods**: Riccati, Lyapunov, pole placement
- **Model reduction**: Balance & Truncate, Hankel-norm
- **System identification**: MOESP, N4SID
- **NumPy integration**: Column-major arrays

## Usage

While you can use this library directly, it's recommended to access it through AI coding agents that understand control theory conventions and SLICOT's API patterns.

**Compatible agents:** Claude Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and other [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io)-compatible tools.

This package includes agent skills for common control theory tasks like PID loop tuning and system analysis.

## Quick Start

```python
import numpy as np
import slicot

# Controllability analysis
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]], order='F')
B = np.array([[1], [0]], order='F')

a_out, b_out, ncont, z, tau, info = slicot.ab01md('I', A, B.flatten(), 0.0)
print(f"Controllable dimension: {ncont}")
```

## Column-Major Arrays

SLICOT uses Fortran conventions:

```python
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]], order='F')  # Required!
```

## Contributions

I don't accept direct contributions. Issues and PRs are welcome for illustration, but won't be merged directly. An AI agent reviews submissions and independently decides whether/how to address them. Bug reports appreciated.
