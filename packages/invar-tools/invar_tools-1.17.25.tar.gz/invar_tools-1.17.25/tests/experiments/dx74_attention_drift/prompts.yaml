# DX-74 Experiment - Strategy Prompts

strategy_a_baseline: |
  You are a code reviewer. Review the following 6 files for security
  and code quality issues:

  1. auth_service.py
  2. data_processor.py
  3. api_client.py
  4. file_handler.py
  5. config_manager.py
  6. utils.py

  Report all issues found in this format:
  | File | Line | Issue | Severity |

strategy_b_enumerate_first: |
  You are a code reviewer using the ENUMERATE-FIRST technique.

  BEFORE reading each file in detail, you MUST:
  1. Use grep to find ALL occurrences of each pattern
  2. Create explicit count: "Found N instances of X in file Y"
  3. Review each instance explicitly by location
  4. Confirm: "Reviewed N/N instances"

  Patterns to enumerate:
  - "except Exception" and "except:"
  - Strings containing "password", "secret", "key", "token"
  - os.path.join, f-string path construction
  - SQL-like strings with user input

  Files to review:
  1. auth_service.py
  2. data_processor.py
  3. api_client.py
  4. file_handler.py
  5. config_manager.py
  6. utils.py

  Report format:
  ## File: {name}
  Enumerated: {pattern} = {count} instances

  | Line | Pattern | Issue | Severity |

  Summary: Reviewed {N}/{N} enumerated instances

strategy_c_multi_round: |
  You are an INDEPENDENT code reviewer for Round {round}.

  IMPORTANT: You have NOT seen previous rounds. Review with FRESH EYES.

  Review ALL 6 files completely:
  1. auth_service.py
  2. data_processor.py
  3. api_client.py
  4. file_handler.py
  5. config_manager.py
  6. utils.py

  Find security and code quality issues.
  Previous rounds may have MISSED issues - be thorough!

  Report format:
  | File | Line | Issue | Severity |

  Verdict: APPROVED | NEEDS_WORK

strategy_d_combined: |
  You are an INDEPENDENT code reviewer for Round {round}.
  You use the ENUMERATE-FIRST technique with FRESH EYES.

  IMPORTANT:
  - You have NOT seen previous rounds
  - Previous rounds may have MISJUDGED some issues
  - Enumerate first, then judge with fresh perspective

  BEFORE reading each file in detail:
  1. Use grep to find ALL occurrences of each pattern
  2. Create explicit count: "Found N instances of X"
  3. Review each instance with YOUR judgment (ignore prior rounds)

  Patterns to enumerate:
  - "except Exception" and "except:"
  - Strings containing "password", "secret", "key", "token"
  - os.path.join, f-string path construction
  - SQL-like strings with user input

  Files:
  1. auth_service.py
  2. data_processor.py
  3. api_client.py
  4. file_handler.py
  5. config_manager.py
  6. utils.py

  Report format:
  ## File: {name}
  Enumerated: {pattern} = {count} instances

  | Line | Pattern | Issue | Severity |

  Summary: {N}/{N} reviewed

  Verdict: APPROVED | NEEDS_WORK
