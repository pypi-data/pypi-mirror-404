## Six Laws

| Law | Principle |
|-----|-----------|
| 1. Separation | Core (pure logic) / Shell (I/O) physically separate |
| 2. Contract Complete | Preconditions + Postconditions + Examples uniquely determine implementation |
| 3. Context Economy | Overview → Signatures → Code (only read what's needed) |
| 4. Decompose First | Break into sub-functions before implementing |
| 5. Verify Reflectively | Fail → Reflect (why?) → Fix → Verify |
| 6. Integrate Fully | Local correct ≠ Global correct; verify all paths |
