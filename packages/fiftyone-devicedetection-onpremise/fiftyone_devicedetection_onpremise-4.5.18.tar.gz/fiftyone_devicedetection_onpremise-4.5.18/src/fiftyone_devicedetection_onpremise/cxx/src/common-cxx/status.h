/**
 * @ingroup FiftyOneDegreesCommon
 * @defgroup FiftyOneDegreesStatus Status
 *
 * Status codes and messages indicating the result of an operation.
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * A status code is an enum indicating the result of an operation, usually
 * the initialisation of something. If the status is anything other than
 * #FIFTYONE_DEGREES_STATUS_SUCCESS, then the operation was not successful. In
 * that case, the status code indicates the nature of the failure. 
 *
 * A status code can be returned by any method that wishes to report a specific
 * error rather than just returning `NULL`.
 *
 * Examples of error status codes are `insufficient memory` or `corrupt data`.
 * If an operation was successful then this is reported in the same way by
 * returning a `success` status code.
 *
 * Status codes have related messages which can be fetched using the
 * #fiftyoneDegreesStatusGetMessage method. The messages are intended to be
 * useful messages which are returned to the user in the event of an error
 * occurring.
 *
 * ## Usage Example
 *
 * ```
 * const char *fileName;
 * fiftyoneDegreesStatusCode status;
 *
 * // Check whether the result of an operation was successful
 * if (status != FIFTYONE_DEGREES_STATUS_SUCCESS) {
 *
 *     // Get the status message as the operation has not succeeded
 *     const char *message = fiftyoneDegreesStatusGetMessage(status, fileName);
 *
 *     // Do something with the message
 *     // ...
 * }
 * ```
