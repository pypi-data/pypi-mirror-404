MIESC - Multi-layer Intelligent Evaluation for Smart Contracts
A Defense-in-Depth Security Framework

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
MIESC combines 25+ security analysis tools
across 9 specialized layers

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Designed for developers, security researchers,
and audit firms

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's explore the 9-layer architecture
Each layer provides a different security perspective

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Layer 1: Static Analysis with Slither, Aderyn, Solhint
Layer 2: Pattern Detection with SmartBugsDetector

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Layer 3: Symbolic Execution with Mythril, Manticore
Layer 4: Fuzzing with Echidna, Medusa, DogeFuzz

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Layer 5: Formal Verification with Certora, Halmos
Layer 6: ML Detection with DA-GNN, SmartGuard

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Layer 7: AI Analysis with SmartLLM, PropertyGPT
Layer 8: DeFi Security with MEV and oracle analyzers

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Layer 9: Dependency Scanning for CVE detection
Now let's analyze a vulnerable smart contract

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This contract has multiple vulnerabilities:
Reentrancy, missing access control, timestamp dependence

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Running the 9-layer Defense-in-Depth scan
Each layer analyzes the contract from a different angle

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Static analysis detects code patterns
Symbolic execution explores all execution paths

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Analysis complete! 5 vulnerabilities detected
2 Critical, 1 High, 1 Medium, 1 Low

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Critical: Reentrancy vulnerability in withdraw()
External call before state update allows attacks

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Critical: Unrestricted setBalance() function
Anyone can modify user balances

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Each finding includes detailed remediation guidance
With code examples for the fix

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
MIESC generates professional audit reports
In HTML, PDF, and JSON formats

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Reports include executive summary, risk score,
detailed findings, and tool evidence

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Scientific validation on SmartBugs benchmark:
84.3% recall, 80% F1-score

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Easy CLI integration for developers
miesc analyze MyContract.sol --deep

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
GitHub Actions integration for CI/CD
Automatic security scanning on every PR

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Python API for security researchers
Integrate MIESC into your audit workflow

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Opening the generated HTML audit report
Professional format ready for clients

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Risk score visualization and severity breakdown
All findings with SWC and CWE references

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Tool evidence preserved for audit trail
Slither, Mythril, and other tool outputs included
