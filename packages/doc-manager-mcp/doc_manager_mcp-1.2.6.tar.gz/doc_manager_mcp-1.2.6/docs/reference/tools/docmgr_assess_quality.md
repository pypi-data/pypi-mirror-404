# Assess quality

**Tool:** `docmgr_assess_quality`

Assess documentation quality against 7 criteria with scores and actionable findings.

## Purpose

Evaluates documentation quality using a structured framework of 7 criteria. Provides scores, specific findings, issues, and metrics to track and improve documentation health over time.

## When to use

- Auditing documentation health before releases
- Tracking quality improvements over time
- Identifying high-priority documentation issues
- Establishing documentation quality baselines
- After major content additions or refactoring

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `project_path` | string | Yes | - | Absolute path to project root |
| `docs_path` | string | No | `null` | Override docs path from config |
| `criteria` | list[string] | No | `null` | Specific criteria to assess (default: all 7) |

## Examples

### Full quality assessment

```python
await mcp.call_tool("docmgr_assess_quality", {
  "project_path": "/path/to/project"
})
```

### Assess specific criteria

```python
await mcp.call_tool("docmgr_assess_quality", {
  "project_path": "/path/to/project",
  "criteria": ["accuracy", "consistency", "clarity"]
})
```

### Custom docs path

```python
await mcp.call_tool("docmgr_assess_quality", {
  "project_path": "/path/to/project",
  "docs_path": "documentation"
})
```

## Quality criteria

### 1. Relevance
**What it measures**: Documentation addresses current user needs and isn't outdated

**Good indicators**:
- Up-to-date feature coverage
- No references to deprecated features
- Addresses common user questions

**Poor indicators**:
- Outdated screenshots or examples
- References to removed features
- Missing coverage of new features

### 2. Accuracy
**What it measures**: Documentation reflects actual codebase state

**Good indicators**:
- High API coverage (documented vs total symbols)
- Documented symbols exist in codebase
- Code examples are valid and tested

**Poor indicators**:
- Low API coverage (<20%)
- Documented symbols don't exist
- Broken code examples

### 3. Purposefulness
**What it measures**: Clear goals and target audience for each document

**Good indicators**:
- Clear introduction stating purpose
- Defined target audience
- Focused content without drift

**Poor indicators**:
- Unclear document purpose
- Mixed audiences in same doc
- Meandering content

### 4. Uniqueness
**What it measures**: No redundant or conflicting information

**Good indicators**:
- Each topic covered once
- No contradictory information
- Clear information hierarchy

**Poor indicators**:
- Duplicate content across files
- Conflicting instructions
- Redundant examples

### 5. Consistency
**What it measures**: Aligned terminology, formatting, and style

**Good indicators**:
- Consistent heading styles
- Uniform code formatting
- Standardized terminology

**Poor indicators**:
- Mixed heading case
- Inconsistent code block formatting
- Same concept with different names

### 6. Clarity
**What it measures**: Precise language and clear navigation

**Good indicators**:
- Concise sentences (<25 words)
- Active voice
- Clear navigation structure
- Minimal vague language

**Poor indicators**:
- Long, complex sentences
- Passive voice overuse
- Vague terms ("just", "simply", "easy")
- Poor navigation

### 7. Structure
**What it measures**: Logical organization and hierarchy

**Good indicators**:
- Logical heading hierarchy (no skipped levels)
- Table of contents for long documents
- Clear section organization

**Poor indicators**:
- Skipped heading levels (H1 → H3)
- Missing TOC on long documents
- Disorganized sections

## Score meanings

- **good**: Meets or exceeds quality standards
- **fair**: Acceptable but has room for improvement
- **poor**: Needs significant improvement

## Notes

- **Read-only**: Only analyzes documentation, makes no changes
- **Comprehensive**: Assesses content, structure, and technical accuracy
- **Actionable**: Provides specific issues and recommendations
- **Metrics-driven**: Includes quantifiable measurements
- **Docstring coverage**: Reports percentage of public symbols with docstrings, broken down by type (class/function/method)
- **Root README**: Includes root README.md if `include_root_readme: true` in config
- **Prerequisites**: Requires baselines for accuracy assessment

## Typical workflow

```text
1. Run docmgr_assess_quality to get baseline scores
2. Review findings and recommendations
3. Make improvements based on issues identified
4. Re-run assessment to track progress
5. Monitor quality trends over time
```
