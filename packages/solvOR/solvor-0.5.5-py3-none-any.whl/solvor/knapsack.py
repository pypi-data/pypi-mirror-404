r"""
0/1 Knapsack solver using dynamic programming.

The problem that launched a thousand algorithms. Select items to maximize value
without exceeding capacity. Each item is all-or-nothing (0/1), no cutting that
gold bar in half.

    from solvor.knapsack import solve_knapsack

    result = solve_knapsack(values, weights, capacity)
    print(result.solution)  # indices of selected items

How it works: DP builds a table asking "what's the best I can do with capacity w?"
for every w from 0 to your limit. Each item either fits (add its value) or doesn't.
Backtrack through the table to find which items were selected.

Use this for:

- Resource allocation with discrete choices
- Budget optimization
- Subset selection problems
- Capital budgeting

Parameters:

    values: value/profit of each item
    weights: weight/cost of each item
    capacity: maximum total weight allowed
    minimize: if True, minimize total value (unusual but supported)

For fractional items, use LP (greedy by value/weight ratio is optimal).
For multiple constraints, use MILP or CP-SAT.
