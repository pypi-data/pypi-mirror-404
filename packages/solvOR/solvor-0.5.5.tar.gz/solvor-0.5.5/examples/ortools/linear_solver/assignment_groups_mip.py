"""
OR-Tools Example: assignment_groups_mip.py

This is a solvOR implementation of the Google OR-Tools example.
Original: https://github.com/google/or-tools/blob/stable/ortools/linear_solver/samples/assignment_groups_mip.py

solvOR provides pure Python solvers for learning and prototyping.
For production-scale problems, consider using Google OR-Tools which
offers compiled C++ solvers with significantly better performance.

Comparison:
- solvOR: Pure Python, readable, educational, no dependencies
- OR-Tools: C++ backend, production-ready, 10-100x faster

Note: This problem requires exactly one allowed pair from each group to work.
Solved by enumerating all 125 group configurations (5x5x5) and using Hungarian
algorithm for each 6-worker assignment. Much faster than general MILP.
