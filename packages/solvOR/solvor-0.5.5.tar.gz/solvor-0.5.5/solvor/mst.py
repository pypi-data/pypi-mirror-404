r"""
Minimum Spanning Tree - connect everything at minimum cost.

One of those rare greedy algorithms that's actually optimal.

    from solvor.mst import kruskal, prim

    result = kruskal(n_nodes, edges)
    result = prim(graph, start=0)

    0 --4-- 1
    |     / |        kruskal picks: 1-2 (2), 0-2 (3), 0-1 (4)
    3   2   5        total weight: 9
    | /     |        skips 1-3 (5) - would create cycle
    2 --6-- 3

Kruskal's is beautifully simple: Kruskal's sorts edges by weight, picks the smallest that doesn't
create a cycle. Uses Union-Find for near O(1) cycle detection. Prim's grows a
tree from a start node using a priority queue, Dijkstra-style.

Use this for:

- Network cabling and infrastructure design
- Clustering (stop early = k clusters)
- Circuit layout
- Any "connect all nodes at minimum cost" problem

Parameters:

    n_nodes: number of nodes (Kruskal's)
    edges: list of (u, v, weight) tuples
    graph: adjacency dict (Prim's)
    allow_forest: return partial result for disconnected graphs

Both algorithms return the same MST. Don't use this for directed graphs
or shortest paths (that's dijkstra).
