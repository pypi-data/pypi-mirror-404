Strongly connected components and topological sorting for directed graphs.

SCC finds groups of nodes where every node can reach every other node in the
group. Topological sort orders nodes so dependencies come before dependents.
Together they're essential for dependency analysis and cycle detection.

    from solvor.scc import strongly_connected_components, topological_sort, condense

    # Find cycles/strongly coupled components
    result = strongly_connected_components(nodes, neighbors)
    # result.solution = [[a, b, c], [d], [e, f]]  # groups of tightly coupled nodes

    # Order by dependencies (fails if cycles exist)
    result = topological_sort(nodes, neighbors)
    # result.solution = [d, e, f, a, b, c]  # dependencies first

    # Create DAG by collapsing SCCs into single nodes
    result = condense(nodes, neighbors)
    # result.solution = (condensed_nodes, condensed_edges)

How it works: SCC uses Tarjan's algorithm with a single DFS pass, tracking
discovery times and low-links. Topological sort uses Kahn's algorithm,
repeatedly removing nodes with no incoming edges. Both are O(V + E).

Use this for:

- Detecting circular dependencies in codebases
- Finding tightly coupled modules that should be grouped
- Ordering build/compilation steps
- Layered architecture validation
- Dependency graph analysis

Parameters:

    nodes: iterable of all nodes in the graph
    neighbors: function returning iterable of outgoing edges (successors)

Works with any hashable node type. For incoming edges (predecessors), swap
the edge direction in your neighbors function.

Note: SCC uses recursion internally. For very deep graphs (>1000 nodes in a
single path), you may need to increase the recursion limit:

    import sys
    sys.setrecursionlimit(5000)  # adjust as needed
