r"""
Dijkstra's algorithm for weighted shortest paths.

The classic algorithm for finding shortest paths in graphs with non-negative
edge weights. Named after Edsger Dijkstra, who designed it in 1956.

    from solvor.dijkstra import dijkstra

    result = dijkstra(start, goal, neighbors)
    result = dijkstra(start, lambda s: s.is_target, neighbors)

How it works: maintains a priority queue of (distance, node) pairs. Each
iteration pops the closest unvisited node, marks it visited, and relaxes
its edges. Guarantees shortest path when all edges are non-negative.

Use this for:

- Road networks and routing
- Any graph where "shortest" means minimum total weight
- When edge weights are non-negative
- As foundation for A* (add heuristic for goal-directed search)

Parameters:

    start: starting node
    goal: target node, or predicate function returning True at goal
    neighbors: function returning (neighbor, edge_cost) pairs

For negative edges use bellman_ford, Dijkstra's negativity was legendary,
just not in his algorithm. For unweighted graphs use bfs (simpler).
With a good distance estimate, use a_star.
