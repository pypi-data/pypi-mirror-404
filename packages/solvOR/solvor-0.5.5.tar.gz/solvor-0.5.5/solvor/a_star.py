r"""
A* search for goal-directed shortest paths with heuristics.

Dijkstra explores in all directions like ripples in a pond. A* knows where it's
going and prioritizes paths that look promising. Give it a heuristic (estimate
to goal) and it expands far fewer nodes.

    from solvor.a_star import astar, astar_grid

    result = astar(start, goal, neighbors, heuristic)
    result = astar_grid(maze, (0, 0), (9, 9), directions=8)

How it works: like Dijkstra but prioritizes by f(n) = g(n) + h(n), where g is
cost so far and h is estimated cost to goal. Heuristic must be admissible
(never overestimate) for optimal results. Weighted A* (weight > 1) trades
optimality for speed.

Use this for:

- Pathfinding with known goal location
- When you have a good distance heuristic
- Grid navigation and game AI
- When Dijkstra is too slow

Parameters:

    start: starting node
    goal: target node or predicate function
    neighbors: returns (neighbor, cost) pairs
    heuristic: estimates distance to goal (must not overestimate)
    weight: heuristic weight, >1 for faster suboptimal search

astar_grid provides built-in heuristics for 2D grids.

Don't use this for: unknown goal (use dijkstra), negative edges (use bellman_ford).
