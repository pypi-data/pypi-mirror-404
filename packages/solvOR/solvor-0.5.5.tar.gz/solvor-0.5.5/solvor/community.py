Community detection for finding clusters in graphs.

Community detection identifies groups of nodes that are more densely connected
to each other than to the rest of the graph. Useful for discovering natural
groupings, modules, or clusters in network data.

    from solvor.community import louvain

    # Social network connections
    friends = {
        "alice": ["bob", "carol"],
        "bob": ["alice", "carol"],
        "carol": ["alice", "bob"],
        "dave": ["eve", "frank"],
        "eve": ["dave", "frank"],
        "frank": ["dave", "eve"],
    }

    result = louvain(friends.keys(), lambda n: friends.get(n, []))
    # result.solution = [{"alice", "bob", "carol"}, {"dave", "eve", "frank"}]

How it works: Louvain algorithm optimizes modularity in two phases. Phase 1:
each node moves to the community that gives the largest modularity gain.
Phase 2: build a new graph where communities become nodes. Repeat until no
improvement. Modularity measures the fraction of edges within communities
minus the expected fraction if edges were random.

Use this for:

- Grouping related code modules (files that import each other)
- Finding clusters of tightly-coupled components
- Discovering subsystems in dependency graphs
- Partitioning for parallel processing

Parameters:

    nodes: iterable of all nodes in the graph
    neighbors: function returning iterable of adjacent nodes (undirected)
    resolution: modularity resolution parameter (default 1.0, higher = smaller communities)

Works with any hashable node type. Treats graph as undirected (edges in both
directions are counted once).
