r"""
Breadth-first and depth-first search for unweighted graphs.

BFS is the polite algorithm: it waits its turn, exploring level by level,
guaranteeing shortest paths. DFS is the curious one: it dives deep before
backtracking, useful when you just need any path or want to explore everything.

    from solvor.bfs import bfs, dfs

    result = bfs(start, goal, neighbors)           # shortest path
    result = dfs(start, goal, neighbors)           # any path
    result = bfs(start, None, neighbors)           # all reachable nodes

How it works: BFS uses a queue (FIFO), DFS uses a stack (LIFO). Both mark
nodes as visited to avoid cycles. O(V + E) time complexity.

Use this for:

- Mazes and grid navigation
- Finding any path or shortest path (unweighted)
- Flood fill and connectivity checks
- When goal is None, explores all reachable nodes

Parameters:

    start: starting node
    goal: target node, predicate function, or None (explore all)
    neighbors: function returning iterable of adjacent nodes

For weighted graphs use dijkstra. For heuristic search use astar.
For negative edges use bellman_ford.
