# Changelog

What broke, what got fixed, and what's new.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-01-31

### Added

- **Branch-and-Price:** Added `solve_bp()` for optimal integer solutions via branch-and-price. Combines column generation with branch-and-bound to find provably optimal integer solutions. Same interface as `solve_cg()` with additional B&B parameters (`max_nodes`, `gap_tol`).

## [0.5.4] - 2026-01-24

### Added

- **Column Generation:** Added `solve_cg()` for problems with exponentially many variables. Implements Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition with LP master problem and customizable pricing. Built-in cutting stock mode with knapsack pricing, or provide your own pricing function for bin packing, vehicle routing, crew scheduling, graph coloring, etc.

- **OR-Tools Examples:** 24 converted examples showing solvOR as drop-in replacement for Google OR-Tools. Organized by category:
  - **Linear Solver (13):** LP, MIP, assignment, bin packing, knapsack problems using `solve_lp`, `solve_milp`, `solve_hungarian`, `solve_bin_pack`
  - **CP-SAT (7):** Constraint satisfaction using `Model` and `solve_job_shop` - simple CSP, N-Queens, nurse scheduling, job shop, solution enumeration
  - **Graph (2):** Max flow and linear sum assignment using `max_flow`, `solve_hungarian`
  - **Algorithms (2):** Knapsack problems using `solve_knapsack`

*All converted examples where generated using AI.

- **OR-Tools Documentation:** New index page at `docs/examples/ortools.md` with benchmark comparisons. solvOR often faster for small problems (pure Python startup vs C++ overhead), competitive on medium problems, OR-Tools wins on large problems as expected.

### Changed

- **MILP:** Greedy rounding + LNS heuristics for binary MIPs. Enable with `lns_iterations` parameter.

### Fixed

- Bugfix for `simplex.py`.

## [0.5.3] - 2025-12-29

Some small QoL improvements and ported all the graph algorithms from another project (AutoMate) which now relies on solvOR.

### Added

- **Graph analysis:** `topological_sort`, `strongly_connected_components`, `condense` for dependency ordering and cycle detection. `pagerank` for node importance. `louvain` for community detection. `articulation_points`, `bridges` for finding critical connections. `kcore_decomposition`, `kcore` for core/periphery analysis.
- **Version:** Added `__version__` to package.

### Changed

- **CI:** Parallelized lint/typecheck jobs, added publish version tag verification.
- **Exports:** Added `Progress`, `ProgressCallback` to public API.
- **Refactor:** Extracted `reconstruct_path` to utils (shared by dijkstra, bfs, a_star).

### Fixed

- **Flow solvers:** Now track iterations correctly.
- **Exports:** Fixed missing `__all__` in utils/validate.py.

## [0.5.2] - 2025-12-28

**Who let de docs out!**
solvOR went through some nice changes. CP got amputated, LP got more company, docs got a full checkup, CI got faster.

### Added

- **CI docs test:** `test_docs.py` runs `mkdocs build --strict` to catch missing type hints and broken links before they reach main.
- **Interior point:** Added `solve_lp_interior()` for linear programming. Primal-dual method with Mehrotra predictor-corrector. Alternative to simplex method.

### Fixed

- **README:** Fixed incorrect `solve_vrptw` example (wrong parameter names, missing customer IDs).

### Changed

- **CP refactor:** Extracted SAT encoding to `cp_encoder.py` (cp.py went from 861 to 428 lines, much easier to read now). `Model.solve()` defaults to `solver="auto"` which picks DFS for simple constraints and SAT for globals (circuit, no_overlap, cumulative, sum_*). Force a specific solver with `solver="dfs"` or `solver="sat"`. Also, `IntVar` now supports multiplication (`x * 3`, `3 * x`) for expressions like `timeslot * n_rooms + room`.
- **Module docstrings:** Standardized all 18 solvor docstrings with consistent format: "How it works" section, "Use this for" bullets, "Parameters" section, r"""string. Same style, so easier when scanning the different solvors.
- **solvOR.ai documentation:** Added "How It Works" sections explaining the math behind 16 algorithms (simplex, interior point, dijkstra, bellman-ford, floyd-warshall, A*, anneal, tabu, genetic, PSO, DE, BFGS, knapsack, bin-packing, SAT, DLX). Also added references, tips, and full signature sections.
- **Tests:** Removed tests with weak assertions, improved edge case coverage. No bugs found (yet).
- **CI/pre-commit:** Turned on uv cache, removed redundant type checks across Python versions, added no-commit-to-branch for main.
- **README:** Added docs badge.

## [0.5.1] - 2025-12-27

### Fixed

- **Documentation consistency pass:** Reviewed all 29 solvors and 7 extended examples against MkDocs pages. Fixed parameter name mismatches, incorrect signatures, and outdated solution formats across 15+ documentation files.

## [0.5.0] - 2025-12-26

**solvOR** is now in beta!

Documentation finally has a proper home. Moved everything from the wiki to MkDocs, deployed at [solvOR.ai](https://solvOR.ai). The wiki now just points there.

### Added

- Documentation site at [solvOR.ai](https://solvOR.ai). MkDocs with Material theme, dark mode by default (as it should be). Getting started, algorithm reference (40+ pages), cookbook with 18 worked examples, API docs, troubleshooting.

- GitHub Actions workflow for docs, auto-deploys to GitHub Pages on push to main.

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** `evolve()` renamed `max_gen` to `max_iter` for consistency. Update your code: `evolve(..., max_gen=100)` → `evolve(..., max_iter=100)`

- `Result` is now generic (`Result[T]`), so type checkers actually know what `.solution` contains. Less red underscores in the IDE.

- Test coverage now statistically significant at 95%, added tests for adam learning rate schedules, genetic adaptive mutation, validation utilities.

- Internal cleanup: `Evaluator` class and `report_progress()` in `solvor/utils/helpers.py`, deduplicated boilerplate across 12 solver files. No API changes for this one.

- Wiki retired, all content now lives at solver.ai. The wiki just points there.

## [0.4.8] - 2025-12-25

Examples! Finally they all work (and can be used as extra tests! optional for now). Also some last changes to solvors that didn't play nice with some of the wikipedia examples. 0.5.0 will be next, which will be considered a "beta" where 0.4.x releases are "alpha". Development cycle will slow down after that, extra maintainers are welcome!

### Added

- **We need examples, lots of examples:**
  - `quick_examples/` minimal working code for every solver, copy-paste ready
  - `classic/` TSP, knapsack, bin packing, job shop, VRP benchmarks
  - `puzzles/` sudoku, n-queens, zebra puzzle, pentomino, magic square
  - `linear_programming/` diet problem, portfolio optimization, blending
  - `machine_learning/` gradient descent for regression (yes it works)
  - `real_world/` nurse scheduling that actually respects constraints

- `py.typed` marker for type checker support

### Changed

- **WIKILEAKS:** Wiki completely up to date, using quick examples from the repo now for consistency. Lots of copy-pasting.

- **Full tests overhaul:** Tests reorganized into `tests/solvers/` and `tests/examples/`, grouped example tests into folder categories. More copy-pasting.

- **CI simplified** the per-solver conditional testing was clever but unmaintainable, just run everything now, tweaked some of the slower tests.

- **Input validation added to graph algorithms and MILP:** bellman_ford, floyd_warshall, mst and milp now tell you what's wrong instead of crashing.

- **Extra parameters:** I don't want to add too many parameters and complexity, but added warm_start to milp and a solution limit. Added `allow_forest=True` for kruskals, which returns minimum spanning forest instead of giving up.

- **README & CONTRIBUTING:** Up-to-date again, were lagging behind with new solvers and parameters, CI changes and more. Should be consistent with the repo's content again.

## [0.4.7] - 2025-12-25

Added a changelog (this file), a whole lot of solvors and some much needed optimizations, working on some more examples, but they need a bit more work still. 
This could have been a 0.5.0 release, if it wasn't for the examples, readme and wiki. Will probably add the examples in the next release, then 0.5.0 with extra tests and more polish (readme/wiki/etc.).

### Added

Santa's been busy, a lot more solvors, focussing on more real world problems, good for some examples I want to add later.

- `vrp` vehicle routing problem
- `lns` large neighborhood search
- `differential_evolution` evolution strategy for continuous optimization
- `particle_swarm` swarm intelligence (just peer pressure for algorithms), also includes "velocity clamping" so particles don't yeet into infinity, which the textbook examples apparently do
- `knapsack` the classic packing problem
- `bin_pack` fit items into bins

- `CHANGELOG.md` to keep track of what was done when for future entertainment/troubleshooting

### Changed
