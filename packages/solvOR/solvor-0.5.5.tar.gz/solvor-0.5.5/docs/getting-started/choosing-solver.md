| `solve_vrptw` | Vehicle routing with time windows |
| `solve_hungarian` | Assignment problem |

## Performance Considerations

- **Small problems (< 100 variables)**: Exact methods (`solve_lp`, `solve_milp`, `Model`)
- **Medium problems (100-10000)**: Hybrid approaches, consider time limits
- **Large problems (> 10000)**: Metaheuristics (`anneal`, `tabu_search`, `lns`)

## Example: Choosing for a Real Problem

**Problem**: Schedule 50 nurses across 30 days with complex constraints.

1. It has discrete decisions (who works when) → Not LP
2. Has complex constraints (no consecutive nights, skill requirements) → Constraint programming is good
3. Size is medium (50 × 30 = 1500 decisions) → Exact method should work

**Answer**: Use `Model` with appropriate constraints.

```python
from solvor import Model

model = Model()
# ... define variables and constraints
result = model.solve(solution_limit=1)
```
