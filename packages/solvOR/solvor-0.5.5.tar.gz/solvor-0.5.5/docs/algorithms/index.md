## Quick Decision Tree

```
Is your objective linear?
├─ Yes → Do you have integer variables?
│        ├─ Yes → solve_milp
│        └─ No → solve_lp
│
└─ No → Can you compute gradients?
         ├─ Yes → Is evaluation expensive?
         │        ├─ Yes → bfgs or lbfgs
         │        └─ No → adam
         │
         └─ No → Is the problem discrete/combinatorial?
                  ├─ Yes → Is it a puzzle/exact cover?
                  │        ├─ Yes → solve_exact_cover or Model
                  │        └─ No → anneal or tabu_search
                  │
                  └─ No → Is evaluation expensive?
                           ├─ Yes → bayesian_opt
                           └─ No → nelder_mead or differential_evolution
```

## Guarantees

Some solvers prove optimality, others don't.

| Guarantee | Solvers |
|-----------|---------|
| **Optimal** | `solve_lp`, `solve_milp`, `solve_bp`, `dijkstra`, `bellman_ford`, `kruskal`, `solve_hungarian` |
| **Heuristic** | `anneal`, `tabu_search`, `evolve`, `particle_swarm` |
| **Local optimum** | `gradient_descent`, `adam`, `bfgs`, `nelder_mead` |

When you need a certificate of optimality, use the exact solvers. When you need speed and "good enough," use heuristics.
