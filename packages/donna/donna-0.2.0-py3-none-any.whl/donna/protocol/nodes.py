    The concept of knowledge graph is highly experimental and subject to change.

    Its primary purpose is to simplify navigation through different Donna's entities
    and to provide a unified interface for retrieving information about them.

    There are two types of child nodes:

    - References — nodes that are referenced by this artifact, but not a part of it.
                   An artifact does not include information from referenced nodes
                   in its info.
                   An artifact include references in its details and index.
    - Components — nodes that are inseparable parts of this artifact.
                   An artifact includes information from them in its info.
                   An artifact does not include components in its details and index,
