# fairyfly-grasshopper

:ant: :green_book: fairyfly plugin for Grasshopper.

This repository contains all Grasshopper components for the fairyfly plugin.
The package includes both the user objects (`.ghuser`) and the Python source (`.py`).
The repository also contains a JSON version of the grasshopper component data.

Note that this library only possesses the Grasshopper components and, in order to
run the plugin, the core libraries must be installed in a way that they can be
discovered by Rhino (see dependencies).

* [ladybug-geometry](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/ladybug-geometry)
