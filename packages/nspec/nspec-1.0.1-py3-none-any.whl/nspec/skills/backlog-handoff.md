description: Generate session handoff summary (auto-detects current spec)
---

Use the `session_start` MCP tool to determine the active spec from `.novabuilt.dev/nspec/state.json`, then generate a handoff summary.

This is designed for context compaction or session restart - no memory of the spec ID required.
