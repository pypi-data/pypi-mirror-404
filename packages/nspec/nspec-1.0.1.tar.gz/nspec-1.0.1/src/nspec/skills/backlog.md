description: View the backlog dashboard - THE COMPASS for project priorities
---

Use `epics` MCP tool to display the backlog dashboard showing all epics with Topline ranking.

This is THE COMPASS - use it to understand project state and priorities.

Display the results clearly with:
- Epic ID, Priority (P0-P3), Status, and Title
- Topline ranking (1-N based on priority)
- Spec counts and completion status

If the user asks "what should I work on?", also check `get_epic` to see if there's an active epic, then `next_spec` to get the next workable spec.
