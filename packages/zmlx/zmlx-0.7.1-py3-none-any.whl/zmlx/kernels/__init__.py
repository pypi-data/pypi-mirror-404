"""Kernel catalog for ZMLX.

These are higher-level, ready-to-use ops built on top of:
- `mx.fast.metal_kernel` (JIT Metal kernels)
- `mx.custom_function` (custom VJP/JVP hooks)

Most functions here compile a specialized kernel on first use for a given shape
(e.g. last-dimension `D`) and threadgroup choice.
