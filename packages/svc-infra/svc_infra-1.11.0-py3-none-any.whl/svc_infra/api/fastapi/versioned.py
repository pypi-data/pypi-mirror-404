    Capture the router from an add_* function for versioned mounting.

    This allows you to use integration functions like add_banking(), add_payments(),
    etc. under versioned routing (e.g., /v0/banking) without creating separate
    documentation cards.

    Args:
        add_function: The add_* function to capture from (e.g., add_banking)
        prefix: URL prefix for the routes (e.g., "/banking")
        **kwargs: Arguments to pass to the add_function

    Returns:
        Tuple of (router, return_value) where:
        - router: The captured APIRouter with all routes
        - return_value: The original return value from add_function (e.g., provider instance)

    Example:
        ```python
        # In routers/v0/banking.py
        from svc_infra.api.fastapi.versioned import extract_router
        from fin_infra.banking import add_banking

        router, banking_provider = extract_router(
            add_banking,
            prefix="/banking",
            provider="plaid",
            cache_ttl=60,
        )

        # svc-infra auto-discovers 'router' and mounts at /v0/banking
        ```

    Pattern:
        1. Creates a mock FastAPI app
        2. Intercepts include_router to capture the router
        3. Patches add_prefixed_docs to prevent separate card creation
        4. Calls the add_function which creates all routes
        5. Returns the captured router for auto-discovery
