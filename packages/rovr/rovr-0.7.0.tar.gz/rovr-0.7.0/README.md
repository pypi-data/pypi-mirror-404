### Installation

```pwsh

uvx git+https://github.com/NSPC911/rovr.git
# Install
## uv (my fav)
uv tool install rovr
## or pipx
pipx install rovr
## or plain old pip
pip install rovr

### Running from source

```pwsh
uv run rovr
```

Running in dev mode to see debug outputs and logs
```pwsh

# or with poethepoet
poe dev
```
the Textual console must also be active to see debug outputs
```pwsh
uv run textual console
# or uvx if not running from source
uvx --from textual-dev textual console
# or just capture print statements
poe log
```
For more info on Textual's console, refer to https://textual.textualize.io/guide/devtools/#console

### FAQ

1. There isn't X theme/Why isn't Y theme available?
    - Textual's currently available themes are limited. However, extra themes can be added via the config file in the format below
    - You can take a look at what each color represents in https://textual.textualize.io/guide/design/#base-colors<br>Inheriting themes will **not** be added.

```toml
[[custom_theme]]
name = "<str>"
primary = "<hex>"
secondary = "<hex>"
success = "<hex>"
warning = "<hex>"
error = "<hex>"
accent = "<hex>"
foreground = "<hex>"
background = "<hex>"
surface = "<hex>"
panel = "<hex>"
is_dark = "<bool>"
variables = {
  "<key>" = "<value>"
}
```

2. Why is it considered post-modern?
    - Parody to my current editor, [helix](https://helix-editor.com)
        - If [NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) is considered modern, then [Helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) is post-modern
        - If [SuperFile](https://github.com/yorukot/superfile) is considered modern, then [rovr](https://github.com/NSPC911/rovr) is post-modern

3. What can I contribute?
    - Themes, and features can be contributed.
    - Refactors will be frowned on, and may take a longer time before merging.

4. I want to add a feature/theme/etc! How do I do so?
    - You need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) at minimum. [prek](https://github.com/j178/prek), [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff) and [ty](https://docs.astral.sh/ty) are recommended to be installed.
    - Clone the repo, and inside it, run `uv sync` and `prek install`.
    - Make your changes, ensure that your changes are properly formatted (via the pre-commit hook), before pushing to a **custom** branch on your fork.
    - For more info, check the [how to contribute](https://nspc911.github.io/rovr/contributing/how-to-contribute) page.

5. How do I make a feature suggestion?
    - Open an issue using the `feature-request` tag, with an estimated difficulty as an optional difficulty level label

6. Why not ratatui or bubbletea??? <sub><i>angry noises</i></sub>
    - I like Python.

7. What's with the name?
    - Kind of a weird thing. [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) is a terminal file manager written in Python. And there is a car brand named Range Rover. Range~~r~~. Hence, I wanted to use "rover", but there is already an existing file explorer named [rover](https://github.com/lecram/rover), so I just removed the "e" to be a bit more fancy.

8. How should I stylize rovr?
    - Just "rovr", please.
