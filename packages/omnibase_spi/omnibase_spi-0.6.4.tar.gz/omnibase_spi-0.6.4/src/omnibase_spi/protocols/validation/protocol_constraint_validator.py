"""Protocol for validating execution constraints don't conflict.

This module defines the protocol for validating that a set of execution
constraints are consistent and achievable within a given execution profile.

Validation Categories:
    - CYCLE_DETECTION: Circular dependencies (A before B, B before A)
    - PHASE_VALIDATION: Impossible phase constraints (requires nonexistent phase)
    - MUST_RUN_CONFLICTS: Conflicting must_run declarations
    - DETERMINISM_VALIDATION: Nondeterministic effects in disallowed phases

Example:
    >>> class MyConstraintValidator:
    ...     async def validate(
    ...         self, profile: ModelExecutionProfile, constraints: list[ModelExecutionConstraints]
    ...     ) -> ModelValidationResult:
    ...         # Implementation here
    ...         ...
    >>>
    >>> # Check protocol compliance
    >>> assert isinstance(MyConstraintValidator(), ProtocolConstraintValidator)

    """Protocol for validating execution constraints don't conflict.

    Validates that a set of execution constraints are consistent and achievable
    within a given execution profile. Detects:

    - Circular dependencies (A before B, B before A)
    - Impossible phase constraints (requires phase that doesn't exist)
    - Conflicting must_run declarations
    - Nondeterministic effects in disallowed phases

    This protocol is designed for NodeConstraintValidatorCompute implementations
    that perform constraint validation as a pure compute operation without
    side effects.

    Example:
        >>> async def validate_workflow_constraints(
        ...     validator: ProtocolConstraintValidator,
        ...     profile: ModelExecutionProfile,
        ...     constraints: list[ModelExecutionConstraints],
        ... ) -> None:

        ...         for issue in result.issues:
        ...             print(f"Conflict: {issue}")
        ...
        ...     # Can also detect cycles independently

        ...     for cycle in cycles:
        ...         print(f"Cycle detected: {cycle.cycle_path}")

    Key Features:
        - **Cycle Detection**: Identifies circular ordering dependencies
        - **Phase Validation**: Ensures phase constraints reference valid phases
        - **Conflict Aggregation**: Collects all conflicts rather than failing fast
        - **Determinism Checks**: Validates effect determinism requirements

    See Also:
        - ModelExecutionProfile: Defines available phases and ordering.
        - ModelExecutionConflict: Describes detected conflicts.

        """Validate that constraints are consistent with the execution profile.

        Performs comprehensive validation of execution constraints against
        the provided execution profile. The validator checks all constraints
        before returning, collecting all conflicts rather than failing on
        the first one.

        Validation Checks:
            - Ordering constraints form a valid DAG (no cycles)
            - All referenced phases exist in the profile
            - No conflicting must_run declarations for exclusive phases
            - Nondeterministic effects are only in allowed phases

        Args:
            profile: The execution profile defining available phases and
                ordering. Contains phase definitions, ordering rules, and
                determinism requirements for each phase.
            constraints: List of execution constraints to validate. Each
                constraint specifies requires_before, requires_after,
                must_run, can_run_parallel, and nondeterministic_effect.

        Returns:
            Validation result with is_valid=True if no conflicts detected,
            or is_valid=False with issues containing ModelExecutionConflict
            instances describing each detected problem.

        Note:
            The validator should check ALL constraints before returning,
            collecting all conflicts rather than failing on the first one.
            This enables comprehensive error reporting and helps users fix
            all issues in a single pass.

        Example:
            >>> profile = get_execution_profile()
            >>> constraints = load_handler_constraints()

        Analyzes the requires_before and requires_after relationships
        between constraints to identify any circular dependencies. Uses
        graph traversal algorithms (e.g., Tarjan's or DFS-based cycle
        detection) to find all strongly connected components.

        Cycle Detection:
            - Builds a directed graph from constraint ordering
            - Identifies strongly connected components
            - Returns conflicts with cycle_path showing the cycle

        Args:
            constraints: List of execution constraints with before/after
                requirements. Each constraint's requires_before and
                requires_after fields define directed edges in the
                dependency graph.

        Returns:
            List of conflicts with conflict_type="cycle" and cycle_path
            populated with the node identifiers forming the cycle.
            Returns empty list if no cycles detected.

        Note:
            This method focuses specifically on cycle detection. For
            comprehensive validation including phase checks and determinism
            validation, use the validate() method instead.
