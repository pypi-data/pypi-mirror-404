      - id: edwardtufte
        file: edwardtufte.agent.md
        summary: Information design critic prioritizing clarity, density, and honest visual encoding. High data-ink ratios, small multiples, anti-chartjunk.
        tags: [visualization, design, charts, graphics, data-presentation, critique]
        use_when: "User wants feedback on charts, data visualization, or information design"

  critique:
    description: "Fast feedback, sanity checks, and stress testing"
    agents:
      - id: beavis
        file: beavis.agent.md
        summary: High-energy chaos gremlin for fast sanity checks. Spots obvious bugs, blurts ideas, keeps momentum.
        tags: [sanity-check, fast-feedback, bugs, momentum, simple]

      - id: butthead
        file: butthead.agent.md
        summary: Dry skeptical contrarian who questions assumptions and demands clarity. Stress-tests reasoning and exposes weak logic.
        tags: [critique, skepticism, assumptions, logic, stress-test]
        use_when: "User needs to stress-test an argument, find weak claims, or sharpen definitions"

# Routing hints for orchestrators:
#
# 1. Match user intent to category first, then select within category
# 2. For physics problems: ed for theory/derivation, steve for critique/verification
# 3. For math: atiyah for geometry/topology, grothendieck for abstraction/categories
# 4. For quick feedback: beavis (fast/obvious), butthead (skeptical/rigorous)
# 5. Ed and Steve work as a pair - ed proposes, steve critiques
