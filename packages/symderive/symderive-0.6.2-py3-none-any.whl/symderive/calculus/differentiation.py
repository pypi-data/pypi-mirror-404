differentiation.py - Differentiation Operations.

Provides differentiation with the D function.

Args:
    expr: Expression to differentiate.
    *args: Variables to differentiate with respect to.

Returns:
    The derivative of the expression.

Internal Refs:
    Uses derive.core.math_api for SymPy operations.

    differentiation.

    D[f, x] - differentiate f with respect to x
    D[f, {x, n}] - differentiate f n times with respect to x
    D[f, x, y] - differentiate f with respect to x, then y

    Args:
        expr: Expression to differentiate
        *args: Variables to differentiate with respect to.
               Can be single symbols or tuples (var, n) for nth derivative.

    Returns:
        The derivative of the expression

    Examples:
        >>> x = Symbol('x')
        >>> D(x**3, x)
        3*x**2
