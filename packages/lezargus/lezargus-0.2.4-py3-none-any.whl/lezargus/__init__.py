# A circular loop may occur in the imports. So, for autoformatting

# isort: split
# The library and configuration must be imported first as all other parts
# depend on it.

# Data files and objects, we need the library to create these objects.

# User-based functionality, the actual commands and interfaces which call
# the above functions.
from lezargus import cli

# Lastly, the main file. We only do this so that Sphinx correctly builds the
# documentation. (Though this too could be a misunderstanding.) Functionality
# of __main__ should be done via the command line interface.
