"""Simulation code to simulate a SPECTRE observation.

This code simulates a SPECTRE observation, from the target on the sky, all
the way to the detector. We use other smaller simulators to simulate common
things (like the object itself or the atmosphere) and the specifics of their
implementations can be found there. Implementation specifics to the SPECTRE
instrument itself are found here.

By self-imposed convention, the attributes are generally named as `at_[stage]`
where the result is the simulated result right after simulating whichever
stage is named.

For ease, we package the smaller simulators within this single simulator class.

            This function does the leg-work of computing an affine
            transformation to emulate the spectral dispersion of mono-chromatic
            slice images. However, default transformations take a while so we
            short cut it by doing a smaller transform on a smaller array and
            putting the smaller array in the right place to emulate the
            full affine transform.

            Moreover, we find that the sheer act of addition is a bit of a
            bottleneck. So, we only add over the regions which the slice
            is actually being applied to, which, by definition, is also
            the same smaller array region for the affine transform.

            Parameters
            ----------
            slice_array : NDArray
                The mono-chromatic slice array data.
            dispersive_corners : NDArray
                The corner locations of where the slice should end up on the
                detector array to properly simulate its dispersion.
            detector_shape : tuple
                The shape of the detector that we are applying the slices to.
                If `detector_data` is provided, this parameter is ignored in
                favor of its shape.
            detector_data : NDArray, default = None
                The current detector data. When the monochromatic slice is
                added to the detector, we only add to the portion that matters
                but to do that, we need the previous data as well which this
                is. If None, we default to an all-zeros detector data based
                on the provided shape.
