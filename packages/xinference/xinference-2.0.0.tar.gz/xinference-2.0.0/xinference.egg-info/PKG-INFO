## Key Features
🌟 **Model Serving Made Easy**: Simplify the process of serving large language, speech 
recognition, and multimodal models. You can set up and deploy your models
for experimentation and production with a single command.

⚡️ **State-of-the-Art Models**: Experiment with cutting-edge built-in models using a single 
command. Inference provides access to state-of-the-art open-source models!

🖥 **Heterogeneous Hardware Utilization**: Make the most of your hardware resources with
[ggml](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml). Xorbits Inference intelligently utilizes heterogeneous
hardware, including GPUs and CPUs, to accelerate your model inference tasks.

⚙️ **Flexible API and Interfaces**: Offer multiple interfaces for interacting
with your models, supporting OpenAI compatible RESTful API (including Function Calling API), RPC, CLI 
and WebUI for seamless model management and interaction.

🌐 **Distributed Deployment**: Excel in distributed deployment scenarios, 
allowing the seamless distribution of model inference across multiple devices or machines.

🔌 **Built-in Integration with Third-Party Libraries**: Xorbits Inference seamlessly integrates
with popular third-party libraries including [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/xinference), [LlamaIndex](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/llm/XinferenceLocalDeployment.html#i-run-pip-install-xinference-all-in-a-terminal-window), [Dify](https://docs.dify.ai/advanced/model-configuration/xinference), and [Chatbox](https://chatboxai.app/).

### Jupyter Notebook

The lightest way to experience Xinference is to try our [Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/xorbitsai/inference/blob/main/examples/Xinference_Quick_Start.ipynb).

### Docker 

Nvidia GPU users can start Xinference server using [Xinference Docker Image](https://inference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/using_docker_image.html). Prior to executing the installation command, ensure that both [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) are set up on your system.

```bash
docker run --name xinference -d -p 9997:9997 -e XINFERENCE_HOME=/data -v </on/your/host>:/data --gpus all xprobe/xinference:latest xinference-local -H 0.0.0.0
```

### K8s via helm

Ensure that you have GPU support in your Kubernetes cluster, then install as follows.

```
# add repo
helm repo add xinference https://xorbitsai.github.io/xinference-helm-charts

# update indexes and query xinference versions
helm repo update xinference
helm search repo xinference/xinference --devel --versions

# install xinference
helm install xinference xinference/xinference -n xinference --version 0.0.1-v<xinference_release_version>
```

For more customized installation methods on K8s, please refer to the [documentation](https://inference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/using_kubernetes.html).

### Quick Start

Install Xinference by using pip as follows. (For more options, see [Installation page](https://inference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html).)

```bash
pip install "xinference[all]"
```

To start a local instance of Xinference, run the following command:

```bash
$ xinference-local
```

Once Xinference is running, there are multiple ways you can try it: via the web UI, via cURL,
 via the command line, or via the Xinference’s python client. Check out our [docs]( https://inference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/using_xinference.html#run-xinference-locally) for the guide.
