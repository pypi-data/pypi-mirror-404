### Features
- **Multi-Provider Support**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI
- **Accurate Pricing**: Real-time cost calculation for 20+ models
- **Budget Enforcement**: Block requests that exceed budgets
- **Alert System**: Configurable thresholds with severity levels
- **Agent Isolation**: Separate budgets per agent
- **Cost Queries**: Query costs by agent, date range, request ID
- **Custom Pricing**: Override pricing for custom models
- **Deployment Mapping**: Azure deployment names to model names
- **Security Integration**: Guardrails + cost tracking in one client

### Performance
- Async-first design for all operations
- Efficient in-memory storage with O(1) lookups
- Parallel guardrail execution
- < 10ms cost calculation overhead

### Documentation
- Updated README with cost tracking and guarded clients sections
- Added 5 comprehensive example scripts
- Full API documentation for all new classes
- Migration guide from v0.2.0

### Dependencies
- Added `openai>=1.0.0` for GuardedOpenAI and GuardedAzureOpenAI
- Added `anthropic>=0.18.0` for GuardedAnthropic
- Added `hypothesis>=6.0.0` for property-based testing (dev)

### Testing
- 71+ new tests for cost tracking and guarded clients
- Property-based tests for correctness validation
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- 61% overall test coverage (focused on new features)

### Notes
- **Feature Parity**: Python SDK now matches TypeScript SDK v0.2.2
- **Breaking Changes**: None - fully backward compatible
- **Migration**: Existing code continues to work without changes

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-30

### Added
- **Client-Side Guardrails** - Offline security protection without server dependency
  - `GuardrailEngine` for parallel/sequential guardrail execution
  - `PIIDetectionGuardrail` - Detect and redact PII (emails, phones, SSNs, credit cards)
  - `ContentModerationGuardrail` - Detect harmful content (hate, violence, harassment)
  - `PromptInjectionGuardrail` - Detect jailbreak and injection attempts
  - Configurable actions: block, allow, redact, mask, transform
  - Timeout protection and error handling with asyncio
  - Pydantic models for type safety
- Comprehensive test suite for guardrails (50 tests passing)

- Full async/await support for all guardrail operations

### Features
- **Offline Capability**: Run guardrails without network calls
- **Parallel Execution**: Execute multiple guardrails simultaneously with asyncio
