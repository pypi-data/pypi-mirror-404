- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the vulnerability** and how an attacker might exploit it
- **Any potential mitigations** you've identified

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - **Critical**: 1-7 days
  - **High**: 7-14 days
  - **Medium**: 14-30 days
  - **Low**: 30-90 days

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment** - We'll confirm receipt of your report
2. **Investigation** - We'll investigate and validate the vulnerability
3. **Fix Development** - We'll develop and test a fix
4. **Disclosure** - We'll coordinate disclosure with you
5. **Credit** - We'll credit you in our security advisories (if desired)

## 🔐 Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| < 0.1.0 | ❌ No              |

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### API Key Management

**Risk**: Exposed API keys can lead to unauthorized access

**Mitigation**:
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use different keys for different environments

```python
# ✅ Good - Use environment variables
import os
from agentguard import AgentGuard

guard = AgentGuard(
    api_key=os.getenv("AGENTGUARD_API_KEY"),
    ssa_url=os.getenv("AGENTGUARD_SSA_URL")
)

# ❌ Bad - Hardcoded API key
guard = AgentGuard(
    api_key="ag_1234567890abcdef",
    ssa_url="http://localhost:3000"
)
```

### Network Security

**Risk**: Man-in-the-middle attacks on unencrypted connections

**Mitigation**:
- Always use HTTPS for SSA connections
- Validate SSL certificates
- Use certificate pinning for high-security environments

```python
# ✅ Good - HTTPS URL
guard = AgentGuard(
    api_key=api_key,
    ssa_url="https://ssa.agentguard.io"
)

# ❌ Bad - HTTP URL
guard = AgentGuard(
    api_key=api_key,
    ssa_url="http://ssa.agentguard.io"
)
```

### Input Validation

**Risk**: Injection attacks through unvalidated inputs

**Mitigation**:
- SDK validates all inputs before sending to SSA
- Use type hints for compile-time validation
- Sanitize user inputs before passing to tools

```python
# ✅ Good - Validated input
from agentguard import AgentGuard

def sanitize_query(query: str) -> str:
    # Remove dangerous characters
    return query.replace(";", "").replace("--", "")

result = guard.execute_tool_sync(
    "database-query",
    {"query": sanitize_query(user_input)},
    {"session_id": session_id}
)
```

### Dependency Security

**Risk**: Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies

**Mitigation**:
- Regular dependency audits (`safety check`)
- Automated dependency updates (Dependabot)
- Minimal dependency footprint
- Pinned dependency versions

## 📋 Security Checklist for Users
