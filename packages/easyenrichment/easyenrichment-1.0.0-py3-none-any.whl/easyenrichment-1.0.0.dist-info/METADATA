## What is Transaction Enrichment?

**Transaction enrichment** (also called transaction categorization, merchant identification, or payment data enrichment) is the process of transforming raw, cryptic bank transaction descriptions like `AMZN Mktp US*RT5KN1Y24` into clean, structured data:

| Raw Description | Merchant Name | Category | Logo | Subscription |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `AMZN Mktp US*RT5KN1Y24` | Amazon | Shopping | ✅ | No |
| `NETFLIX.COM 8662458999` | Netflix | Entertainment | ✅ | Yes |
| `UBER *EATS PENDING` | Uber Eats | Food & Dining | ✅ | No |
| `APPLE.COM/BILL` | Apple | Technology | ✅ | Yes |
| `SQ *BLUE BOTTLE COFFEE` | Blue Bottle Coffee | Coffee Shops | ✅ | No |

The **Easy Enrichment API** provides best-in-class transaction enrichment at a fraction of the cost of Plaid Enrich, Ntropy, or Mastercard Ethoca. Built on advanced AI models including Claude, it delivers industry-leading accuracy for merchant name extraction, transaction categorization, logo identification, subscription detection, and more.

data = result["data"]

print(f"Merchant: {data['merchant_name']}")      # "Spotify"

### Batch Enrichment

Process up to 100 transactions at once for maximum efficiency:

```python
from easyenrichment import EasyEnrichment

client = EasyEnrichment("your-api-key")

transactions = [
    "NETFLIX.COM 8662458999",
    "UBER *EATS PENDING",

    "APPLE.COM/BILL",
    "SQ *BLUE BOTTLE COFFEE",
    "GOOGLE *YouTube Premium",

result = client.enrich_batch(transactions)

for item in result["data"]:
    print(f"{item['merchant_name']:20s} | {item['category']:20s} | Sub: {item['is_subscription']}")
```

Output:

by_category = defaultdict(list)
for item in result["data"]:
    by_category[item["category"]].append(item["merchant_name"])

for category, merchants in sorted(by_category.items()):
    print(f"\n{category}:")
