# Task 1: Review Supporting Documentation

**Phase:** 3 (Task Breakdown)  
**Purpose:** Re-read design doc for implementation phases context  
**Estimated Time:** 3-5 minutes

---

## 🎯 Objective

Re-read relevant sections of the supporting documentation to ensure accuracy for task breakdown phase. Do NOT work from memory - actively re-read and extract current information from source.

---

## Prerequisites

🛑 EXECUTE-NOW: Phase 2 must be completed

Supporting docs must be in `supporting-docs/` directory.

---

## Steps

### Step 1: Locate Supporting Documentation

```bash
ls -la supporting-docs/
cat supporting-docs/INDEX.md
```

Identify primary design document(s).

### Step 2: Re-Read Implementation-Specific Sections

⚠️ CRITICAL: Re-read from source, don't work from memory

**Sections to review:**
- [ ] "Implementation Phases" or "Roadmap" section
- [ ] "Task Breakdown" or "Development Plan" section
- [ ] "Dependencies" or "Critical Path" section
- [ ] "Time Estimates" section
- [ ] "Acceptance Criteria" examples

**Extract and note:**
- Suggested phase breakdown
- Major milestones
- Task dependencies
- Time estimates (realistic, not optimistic)
- Critical path items
- Validation gates mentioned

### Step 3: Verify Implementation Understanding

Answer these questions from the source material:
- What are the major implementation phases?
- What are the dependencies between tasks?
- What's the critical path?
- Are there specific acceptance criteria examples?

📊 COUNT-AND-DOCUMENT: Sections reviewed [number], phases identified [number]

## Completion Criteria

🛑 VALIDATE-GATE: Task Completion

Before proceeding:
- [ ] Primary design doc re-read for implementation sections ✅/❌
- [ ] Phase breakdown understood (not from memory) ✅/❌
- [ ] Dependencies and critical path extracted ✅/❌
- [ ] Ready to create tasks.md with verified facts ✅/❌

🚨 FRAMEWORK-VIOLATION: Working from memory

Do NOT proceed if you haven't actually re-read the supporting docs. Memory from earlier phases is unreliable - verify against source at each phase.

## Next Task

🎯 NEXT-MANDATORY: [task-2-identify-phases.md](task-2-identify-phases.md)

Continue to identify implementation phases using reviewed information.
