When to Use These Guides
------------------------

Use these advanced tracing techniques when you need:

- **Span enrichment** - Add custom metadata and context to individual traces
- **Session enrichment** - Add metadata and context to entire sessions (collections of spans)
- **Custom spans** - Manually create spans for business logic
- **Class decorators** - Automatically trace entire classes
- **Advanced patterns** - Context propagation, sampling, correlation
- **Tracer discovery** - Understand how tracer resolution works
