- Making architectural decisions

## Standards to Follow
Always reference:
- `.agent-os/standards/best-practices.md` for development practices (includes Agent OS spec standards)
- `.agent-os/standards/tech-stack.md` for technology choices
- `.agent-os/standards/code-style.md` for coding standards

## Critical Product Rules
1. **NO MOCKS IN INTEGRATION TESTS** - Integration tests must use real systems
2. **Multi-instance support** - No singleton pattern allowed
3. **Graceful degradation** - Never crash host applications
4. **Type safety** - All functions must have type hints and docstrings
5. **EventType enums** - Never use string literals in documentation
6. **Test coverage** - Minimum 80% project-wide
7. **Tox testing** - Never use pytest directly
