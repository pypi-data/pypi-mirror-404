The breed is divided into four varieties based on size, the Standard Poodle, Medium Poodle, Miniature Poodle and Toy Poodle, although the Medium Poodle is not universally recognised. They have a distinctive thick, curly coat that comes in many colours and patterns, with only solid colours recognised by major breed registries. Poodles are active and intelligent, and are particularly able to learn from humans. Poodles tend to live 10–18 years, with smaller varieties tending to live longer than larger ones."

The breed is accepted by all North American cat registries. Originally known as the Domestic Shorthair, in 1966 the breed was renamed the American Shorthair to better represent its "all-American" origins and to differentiate it from other short-haired breeds. The name American Shorthair also reinforces the breed\'s pedigreed status as distinct from the random-bred non-pedigreed domestic short-haired cats in North America, which may nevertheless resemble the American Shorthair. Both the American Shorthair breed and the random-bred cats from which the breed is derived are sometimes called working cats because they were used for controlling rodent populations, on ships and farms. The American Shorthair (then referred to as the Domestic Shorthair) was among the first five breeds that were registered by the CFA in 1906.'
