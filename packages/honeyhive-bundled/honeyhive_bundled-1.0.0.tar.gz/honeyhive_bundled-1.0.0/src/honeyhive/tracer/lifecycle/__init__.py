"""Tracer lifecycle management for shutdown and cleanup operations.

This module provides comprehensive lifecycle management for HoneyHive tracer
instances, including graceful shutdown, resource cleanup, and proper handling
of multi-instance architectures.

The module is organized into sub-components but maintains a unified public API
for backward compatibility with existing usage patterns.
