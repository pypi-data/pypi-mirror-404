# AI Analysis Methodology
**How to conduct thorough, systematic analysis leveraging AI capabilities**

---

## 🎯 TL;DR - AI Analysis Methodology Quick Reference

**Keywords for search**: AI analysis, systematic analysis, comprehensive analysis, how to analyze, analysis methodology, AI capabilities, correlation analysis, analysis depth, exhaustive analysis, thorough analysis

**Core Principle:** Your superpower is consuming and correlating massive amounts of data quickly. Use it. "Comprehensive" for AI means ACTUALLY comprehensive, not human-limited.

**When User Says "Analysis" or "Comprehensive":**
1. ✅ Read ALL relevant sources (not samples)
2. ✅ Query ALL relevant knowledge bases
3. ✅ Build systematic correlation matrix
4. ✅ Provide evidence for every claim
5. ✅ Show your work (what you examined)
6. ✅ Give actionable recommendations

**Four-Phase Methodology:**
1. **Comprehensive Data Collection** - Gather ALL information (not samples)
2. **Systematic Correlation** - Find patterns, gaps, relationships
3. **Evidence-Based Synthesis** - Build conclusions from data
4. **Actionable Recommendations** - Prioritized, specific guidance

**Analysis Depth Levels:**
- "Quick check" → 2-3 sources, surface scan
- "Review" → Key sources + cross-references
- **"Analysis"** → 🚨 ALL sources, systematic, evidence-based
- "Assessment" → Analysis + scoring + recommendations

**Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- ❌ Reading only 2-3 files then saying "comprehensive"
- ❌ Sampling instead of exhaustive examination
- ❌ Making claims without evidence
- ❌ Stopping at "probably"/"likely" without verification
- ❌ Pretending to have human limitations you don't have

**Quality Check:**
"Could an expert ask 'Did you check X?' and I'd say 'No'?"
→ If YES, analysis is incomplete

## 🎯 Core Principle

**"Your superpower is the ability to consume and correlate massive amounts of data quickly, then reason about it."**

Unlike humans, you:
- ✅ Can read 100+ documents in parallel without fatigue
- ✅ Can query multiple knowledge bases simultaneously
- ✅ Can correlate thousands of data points instantly
- ✅ Can maintain perfect attention across large datasets
- ✅ Can systematically examine every corner of a codebase

**Therefore: "Comprehensive" for AI means ACTUALLY comprehensive, not human-limited.**

## 🚨 Critical Distinction

### ❌ Human-Limited Approach (WRONG for AI)
```
User: "Do a comprehensive analysis"
AI: *Reads 2-3 files*
AI: "Based on these samples, I think..."
```

**Problem**: You're pretending to have human limitations you don't have.

### ✅ AI-Leveraged Approach (CORRECT)
```
User: "Do a comprehensive analysis"
AI: *Reads ALL relevant sources*
AI: *Queries ALL knowledge bases*
AI: *Builds systematic correlation matrix*
AI: "After examining 47 files and correlating findings..."
```

**Result**: You're using your actual capabilities.

## 📋 Analysis Depth Indicators

**When user says these words, they expect different depth levels:**

| User Request | Expected Depth | Action Required |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **"Quick check"** | Surface scan | 2-3 key sources, 1-2 minute review |
| **"Look at"** | Focused read | Specific files/sections, verify key points |
| **"Review"** | Moderate coverage | Key sources + verification, cross-references |
| **"Analysis"** | 🚨 **COMPREHENSIVE** | ALL sources, systematic correlation, evidence-based |
| **"Deep dive"** | Exhaustive | Analysis + historical context + edge cases |
| **"Assessment"** | Full evaluation | Analysis + scoring + recommendations + priorities |

### 🚨 When User Says "Analysis" or "Comprehensive"

**MANDATORY steps:**

1. **Read ALL relevant sources** (not samples)
2. **Query ALL relevant knowledge bases**
3. **Build systematic comparison/correlation**
4. **Provide evidence for every claim**
5. **Show your work** (what you examined)
6. **Give actionable recommendations**

## 📊 Four-Phase Analysis Methodology

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Data Collection

**Objective**: Gather ALL relevant information

**Actions**:
```markdown
□ Identify all relevant sources
□ Read complete documents (not snippets)
□ Query all applicable knowledge bases (MCP, codebase search, etc.)
□ Examine related files/directories systematically
□ Collect historical context (git log, previous decisions)
□ Document what was examined (for transparency)
```

**Anti-Patterns**:
- ❌ Reading only the first few results
- ❌ Stopping after "enough" information
- ❌ Skipping sources because "probably similar"
- ❌ Using only one search method

**Quality Check**:
> "If I were explaining this analysis to an expert, would they ask 'Did you check X?' and I'd have to say 'No, I didn't look at that'?"
> 
> If YES → Data collection incomplete

### Phase 2: Systematic Correlation

**Objective**: Find patterns, gaps, and relationships

**Actions**:
```markdown
□ Build comparison matrices (concept by concept)
□ Identify patterns across sources
□ Find gaps and inconsistencies
□ Cross-reference findings
□ Map relationships between concepts
□ Quantify where possible (counts, percentages, ratios)
```

**Techniques**:
- **Correlation Matrix**: Source A vs Source B by category
- **Gap Analysis**: Expected vs Actual
- **Pattern Recognition**: Repetition across sources
- **Dependency Mapping**: What relies on what

**Example**:
```markdown
| Concept | Source A | Source B | Gap? |
|---------|----------|----------|------|
| Validation Gates | ✅ Defined | ✅ Used | No gap |
| Pre-generation Checklist | ✅ Detailed | ❌ Not found | GAP |
```

### Phase 3: Evidence-Based Conclusions

**Objective**: Support every claim with evidence

**Actions**:
```markdown
□ State findings clearly
□ Cite specific sources for each claim
□ Show examples from data
□ Quantify impact where possible
□ Distinguish facts from inferences
□ Note confidence levels
```

**Evidence Standards**:
- **Fact**: Direct quote or verifiable data point
- **Pattern**: Multiple examples showing consistency
- **Gap**: Systematic search showing absence
- **Inference**: Logical conclusion from facts (label as such)

**Format**:
```markdown
**Finding**: [Statement]
**Evidence**: [Source/Quote/Data]
**Impact**: [Quantified or qualified]
```

### Phase 4: Actionable Recommendations

**Objective**: Provide specific, prioritized next steps

**Actions**:
```markdown
□ Prioritize by impact (Critical → High → Medium → Low)
□ Make recommendations specific and actionable
□ Provide implementation guidance
□ Estimate effort where relevant
□ Explain rationale for priorities
```

**Recommendation Quality Criteria**:
- ✅ Specific: "Create X.md with Y content" not "Consider improving docs"
- ✅ Actionable: Clear what to do, who does it, when
- ✅ Prioritized: Must-have vs nice-to-have with reasoning
- ✅ Feasible: Realistic given constraints

## 🚨 Common Analysis Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 1: Surface Scanning
```
User: "Do a comprehensive analysis of our standards"
AI: *Reads 3 files*
AI: "Based on what I see, we have good coverage"
```

**Problem**: Claimed comprehensive but only sampled

**Fix**: Read ALL files, query MCP exhaustively, build full correlation

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 2: Unsupported Claims
```
AI: "We're missing validation protocols"
User: "How do you know?"
AI: "I didn't find them"
User: "Did you search the MCP?"
AI: "...no"
```

**Problem**: Claimed absence without systematic search

**Fix**: Query MCP, grep codebase, check multiple locations before claiming absence

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 3: Vague Recommendations
```
AI: "You should improve the documentation"
User: "How? What specifically?"
AI: "Make it more comprehensive"
```

**Problem**: Not actionable

**Fix**: "Create `.praxis-os/standards/ai-assistant/README.md` with these sections: [specific list]"

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 4: Hidden Methodology
```
AI: "After analysis, I found 5 gaps"
User: "What did you analyze?"
AI: "The standards"
User: "Which ones? How many files?"
AI: "Um..."
```

**Problem**: Can't verify completeness

**Fix**: "After examining 23 files in python-sdk and querying agent-os MCP 8 times, I found..."

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 5: No Prioritization
```
AI: "Here are 20 things that need to be done"
User: "Which ones matter most?"
AI: "They're all important"
```

**Problem**: Everything urgent = nothing urgent

**Fix**: "CRITICAL (blocks AI): 3 items. HIGH (reduces quality): 5 items. NICE TO HAVE: 12 items."

```markdown
Human: Forgets details after reading 50 pages
AI: Retains every detail from 500+ pages

Action: Cite exact quotes and line numbers
```

**Systematic Exhaustiveness**:
```markdown
Human: Might miss edge cases when tired
AI: Can systematically check every condition

Action: Build complete matrices, check every case
```

**Cross-Correlation**:
```markdown
