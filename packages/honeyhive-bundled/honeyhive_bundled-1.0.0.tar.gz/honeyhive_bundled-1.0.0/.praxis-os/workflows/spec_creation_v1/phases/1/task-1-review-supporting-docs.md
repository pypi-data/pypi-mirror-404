# Task 1: Review Supporting Documentation

**Phase:** 1 (Requirements Gathering)  
**Purpose:** Re-read design doc for requirements context  
**Estimated Time:** 3-5 minutes

---

## 🎯 Objective

Re-read relevant sections of the supporting documentation to ensure accuracy for requirements phase. Do NOT work from memory - actively re-read and extract current information from source.

---

## Prerequisites

🛑 EXECUTE-NOW: Phase 0 must be completed

Supporting docs must be in `supporting-docs/` directory.

---

## Steps

### Step 1: Locate Supporting Documentation

```bash
ls -la supporting-docs/
cat supporting-docs/INDEX.md
```

Identify primary design document(s).

### Step 2: Re-Read Requirements-Specific Sections

⚠️ CRITICAL: Re-read from source, don't work from memory

**Sections to review:**
- [ ] "Business Goals" or "Executive Summary" section
- [ ] "Requirements" or "Functional Requirements" section  
- [ ] "Success Metrics" or "KPIs" section
- [ ] "Constraints" or "Out of Scope" section
- [ ] Any user stories or use cases

**Extract and note:**
- Specific numbers (metrics, targets, limits)
- Business objectives with rationale
- User personas and their needs
- Success criteria (measurable outcomes)
- Explicit constraints or limitations

### Step 3: Verify Understanding

Answer these questions from the source material:
- What problem does this solve?
- Who benefits and how?
- What are the measurable success criteria?
- What's explicitly out of scope?

## Completion Criteria

🛑 VALIDATE-GATE: Task Completion

Before proceeding:
- [ ] Primary design doc re-read for requirements sections ✅/❌
- [ ] Business goals understood (not from memory) ✅/❌
- [ ] Success metrics extracted with specific numbers ✅/❌
- [ ] Ready to create srd.md with verified facts ✅/❌

🚨 FRAMEWORK-VIOLATION: Working from memory

Do NOT proceed if you haven't actually re-read the supporting docs. Memory from Phase 0 is unreliable - verify against source at each phase.
