              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

High-throughput parallelization enabling long-running experiments to persist across sessions without restarting computations.


apsimNGpy 0.39.11.20 – Release Notes
=================================================

This release introduces a dedicated simulation file context manager that automatically removes transient .apsimx files and all associated output database files (.db, .db-wal, .db-sha, etc.) at the end of a with block.
This lets users run temporary simulations with confidence that intermediate files will not accumulate on disk — especially important for large workflows such as optimization loops, Monte-Carlo runs, or multi-site batch simulations.

To achieve this, the context manager now coordinates more carefully with APSIM-NG’s I/O locking behavior. In particular, it triggers the underlying C# garbage collector (when necessary) to ensure the write-locks on the result database are fully released before deletion.
Because of that, there is a small (but practically negligible) performance overhead; future versions may expose a switch to disable this behaviour for users who do not require automatic cleanup.

This release also adds a second context manager for temporary APSIM bin-path management.
It allows users to specify a local APSIM-NG installation path for a given script/module while preserving the global default in memory — enabling cleaner multi-version testing or workflow portability without rewriting environment variables.

Temporary simulations using a context manager
=================================================

.. code-block:: python

   from apsimNGpy.core.apsim import ApsimModel
   with ApsimModel("template.apsimx") as temp_model:
       temp_model.run()
       df = temp_model.results
       print(df)
  # temporary .apsimx and .db files created


Immediately after exiting the with block, the temporary .apsimx file (and its associated .db files) are deleted,
since only clones of the original model file are used inside the context.

Temporary APSIM-bin path
===========================

.. code-block:: python

    from apsimNGpy.core.config import apsim_bin_context
    with apsim_bin_context("C:/APSIM/2025.05.1234/bin"):
        from Models.Core import Simulations   # uses this bin path for loading
        from apsimNGpy.core.apsim import ApsimModel

Immediately after exiting the with block, the path is restored back to the global APSIM path — meaning that other projects and modules can continue to access their own settings normally. The importance of this pattern is reproducibility: it allows your project to be “locked” to a specific APSIM binary path.
APSIM versions change frequently, and a future run of your current project might fail or give different results if a newer APSIM version is picked up without you realizing it. By scoping a local APSIM bin path for this project, you ensure that reruns in the future use exactly the same APSIM version that generated the original results.
This makes the workflow both reproducible and stable.

Note
=====

Since the model assemblies are already loaded into memory inside the `apsim_bin_context`, you do not need to remain inside the
`with` block to keep using them. Once loaded, those modules (and their namespaces) are global within the process, and they retain
their reference to the APSIM bin path that was supplied during loading.



The bin path can also be substituted with just the project `.env` path as follows

.. code-block:: python

   with apsim_bin_context( dotenv_path = './config/.env', bin_key ='APSIM_BIN_PATH'):
        from Models.Core import Simulations   # uses this bin path for loading
        from apsimNGpy.core.apsim import ApsimModel # uses this bin path for loading


v0.39.10.18 (2025-10-24)
=========================

Added

- ``preview_simulation(watch=True)`` now supports **interactive edit syncing**:
  - Opens the ``.apsimx`` file in the APSIM NG GUI and *watches* for saved edits.
  - When a user saves in the GUI, changes are automatically reloaded into the active ``ApsimModel`` instance.
  - Console messages guide users during the live session (e.g., *“Watching for GUI edits... Save in APSIM to sync back.”*).
  - Graceful shutdown supported via ``Ctrl+C``; after termination, the Python model reflects the most recent GUI state.
  - Users should close the GUI after completing edits before continuing with the Python model instance.

Notes
======

- This feature is **experimental** but stable in tests.
- Synchronization assumes that both APSIM GUI and Python edit the same ``.apsimx`` file path.
- If ``watch=False`` (default), ``preview_simulation`` behaves as before — no live syncing.
- GUI edits must be **saved** before synchronization occurs. Unsaved edits are ignored.
