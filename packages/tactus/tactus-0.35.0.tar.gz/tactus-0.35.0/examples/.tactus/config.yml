# Directory-wide configuration for all example procedures
# This config cascades to all .tac files in the examples/ directory
#
# This configuration makes the "done" tool available by default to all agents
# in example procedures. The "done" toolset is built-in to the runtime and
# doesn't need to be defined here - we just reference it in default_toolsets.

# Default toolsets applied to all agents that don't specify tools
# Agents can override this by specifying their own tools list
default_toolsets:
  - done  # References the built-in "done" toolset from the runtime

# Configuration notes:
# 1. Agents with no tools key will get default_toolsets
# 2. Agents with tools = [] will get NO tools (explicitly empty)
# 3. Agents with tools = ["done"] will get only the done tool
# 4. Agents can use toolset expressions for filtering/transformation:
#    tools:
#      - "done"                                    # Include entire toolset
#      - {name: "mcp_server", include: ["tool1"]} # Filter to specific tools
#      - {name: "plugins", prefix: "local_"}      # Add prefix to all tools
