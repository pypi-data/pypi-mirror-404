# GDAL MCP Vision

**Status**: Living Document  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-26  
**Purpose**: Define the long-term vision and guiding principles for gdal-mcp development

---

## Executive Summary

**gdal-mcp is not a drop-in replacement for GDAL commands.**

It is a foundation for **agentic geospatial reasoning** - enabling AI agents to understand spatial problems, compose analytical workflows, and bridge the gap between domain expertise and technical implementation.

---

## The Problem We're Solving

### The Current Reality

Geospatial analysis requires two forms of expertise that rarely coexist in one person:

1. **Domain Knowledge**: Understanding terrain, hydrology, ecology, geology, urban planning, etc.
2. **Technical Implementation**: GDAL syntax, projection systems, algorithm parameters, data formats, etc.

**This creates barriers:**

- A 30-year veteran hydrologist who deeply understands watersheds cannot perform basic slope analysis because they don't know GDAL syntax
- A GIS analyst spends hours on Stack Overflow translating "what I want to do" into "the exact command to do it"
- Domain experts are blocked by technical complexity, not lack of understanding
- Knowledge remains siloed: experts can't operationalize their insights without developers

### Why This Matters

**Geospatial expertise is being wasted.** People who understand the science cannot apply their knowledge because the tools require a different kind of expertise entirely.

---

## The Vision

### What Success Looks Like

**In 5 years, a domain expert should be able to:**

> "Show me all areas where slope exceeds 30 degrees within 500 meters of perennial streams, excluding urban zones, and calculate the erosion risk for each parcel."

**And receive:**
- A complete analysis workflow executed correctly
- Results with spatial context
- Explanation of methodology
- Ability to refine and iterate in natural language

**No GDAL commands. No Python scripts. No Stack Overflow.**

Just domain expertise expressed in domain language, translated to precise geospatial operations by an AI agent that understands both.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Agentic Reasoning Over Command Translation

**Not This:**
```
User: "Reproject to Web Mercator"
AI: Executes gdalwarp with EPSG:3857
```

**This:**
```
User: "I need to display this elevation model in a web map"
AI: Reasons about requirements
    → Web display needs Web Mercator
    → Elevation models need appropriate resampling
    → Executes reprojection with cubic resampling
    → Suggests COG format for web performance
    → Explains why these choices were made
```

**The AI should understand *why*, not just *what*.**

### 2. Multi-Step Workflow Composition

**Not This:**
- Single tool calls in isolation
- User manually chains operations
- No context between steps

**This:**
- AI plans entire workflows
- Understands data flow between steps
- Optimizes processing order
- Handles intermediate results
- Adapts based on data characteristics

**Example:**
```
User: "Identify potential landslide zones in this region"

AI Reasoning:
1. Understand requirement: slope analysis + hydrology
2. Check available data: DEM, stream network, soil maps
3. Plan workflow:
   - Extract slope from DEM
   - Identify steep areas (>30°)
   - Calculate distance to streams
   - Overlay with soil permeability
   - Combine factors into risk score
4. Execute pipeline
5. Return spatially-indexed results
6. Explain methodology and assumptions
```

### 3. Domain Language, Not Technical Syntax

**Domain experts speak in:**
- Watersheds, not polygons
- Slope, not derivatives
- Riparian zones, not buffers
- Erosion potential, not algorithms

**The AI must:**
- Understand domain terminology
- Translate to technical operations
- Preserve semantic intent
- Explain in domain terms

### 4. Accessibility Without Compromise

**Target Users:**
- Hydrologists who understand watersheds but not programming
- Ecologists who understand habitat but not GIS
- Geologists who understand terrain but not GDAL
- Urban planners who understand zoning but not spatial analysis
- Field researchers who collect data but can't process it

**These users have:**
- Deep domain expertise (decades)
- Limited technical background
- Real analytical needs
- No time to learn GDAL

**They should not be limited by technical barriers.**

## Phased Implementation

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅ Complete (v0.1.0)

**Goal**: Establish reliable base operations

- Core GDAL tools (info, convert, reproject, stats)
- Robust error handling
- Production-ready infrastructure
- MCP protocol compliance
- Security (workspace scoping)

**Status**: ✅ Complete

### Phase 2: Epistemic Middleware & Tool Parity ✅ Complete (v1.0.0 - v1.1.1)

**Goal**: Build epistemic reasoning layer and comprehensive tool coverage

**Completed**:
- ✅ **Reflection middleware system** (v1.0.0)
  - Pre-execution justification for CRS, resampling, hydrology, aggregation
  - Domain-based cache sharing (validated v1.1.1)
  - Advisory prompting that respects user autonomy
- ✅ **Complete vector tool suite** (v1.1.1)
  - Vector operations (reproject, convert, clip, buffer, simplify, info)
  - Feature parity with raster capabilities
- ✅ **Cross-domain reflection** (v1.1.1)
  - Methodological reasoning transcends data types
  - 75% cache hit rate in multi-operation workflows
- ✅ Comprehensive format conversions
- ✅ Multi-band operations
- ✅ Metadata management

**Key Innovation**: Domain-based (not tool-based) epistemic reasoning. A CRS justification works for both raster and vector operations because the methodology is about the projection's properties, not the data type.

**Focus**: Building the toolkit with methodological guardrails

**Current Status**: v1.1.1 (2025-10-26)

### Phase 3: Workflow Intelligence (v2.0 - In Planning)

**Goal**: Enable multi-step reasoning and composition

**Planned**:
- Workflow planning capabilities
- Inter-tool data flow orchestration
- Intermediate result management
- Progress tracking for long operations
- Context-aware tool selection
- Composition pattern discovery

**Foundation Ready**: The reflection cache already enables workflow context (justifications carry across operations). Phase 3 will formalize this into explicit workflow management.

**Focus**: Moving from tools to workflows

### Phase 4: Domain Understanding (v2.x+)

**Goal**: Agentic geospatial reasoning

- Domain concept recognition (watersheds, viewsheds, etc.)
- Methodology libraries (standard analytical workflows)
- Adaptive algorithms (choose methods based on data)
- Explanation generation (why these steps?)
- Quality assessment (validate results)

**Focus**: AI that understands geospatial science

### Phase 5: Collaborative Intelligence (v3.x+)

**Goal**: Human-AI partnership for complex analysis

- Interactive refinement
- "What if" scenario modeling
- Automated quality checks
- Knowledge capture (learn from domain experts)
- Workflow templates from successful analyses

**Focus**: Amplifying human expertise with AI reasoning

## What This Is Not

### We Are Not Building:

❌ **QGIS in chat form** - We're enabling reasoning, not replicating GUIs  
❌ **GDAL command generator** - We're composing workflows, not translating syntax  
❌ **Black-box magic** - We're making expertise accessible, not hiding complexity  
❌ **Replacement for domain knowledge** - We're amplifying expertise, not replacing it

### We Are Building:

✅ **A bridge** between domain expertise and technical implementation  
✅ **An amplifier** for geospatial knowledge that's currently trapped  
✅ **A foundation** for AI that understands spatial reasoning  
✅ **A democratizer** making powerful analysis accessible to experts

## Guiding Questions for Development

When evaluating features, ask:

1. **Does this enable reasoning or just execution?**
   - Good: "AI can understand why this operation is needed"
   - Bad: "AI can execute this command faster"

2. **Does this help domain experts or technical users?**
   - Good: "A hydrologist can express this in domain terms"
   - Bad: "A developer can write this command easier"

3. **Does this compose or isolate?**
   - Good: "This tool connects to other operations naturally"
   - Bad: "This tool only works in isolation"

4. **Does this explain or obscure?**
   - Good: "Users understand what happened and why"
   - Bad: "It works but users don't know how"

## Call to Action

**This vision will take years to realize.** It requires:

- Incremental, thoughtful development
- Partnership with domain experts
- Commitment to accessibility
- Patience with complexity
- Community collaboration

**But the destination is worth it:**

A world where geospatial expertise is no longer limited by technical barriers. Where hydrologists can analyze watersheds, ecologists can map habitats, and geologists can model terrain - all through natural conversation with AI that understands their domain.

**That's the vision. That's what we're building.**
