# Adversarial Workflow

This project uses the **Author-Evaluator adversarial workflow** for quality-controlled development.

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup
```bash
# API keys are already configured in .env
# Configuration is in .adversarial/config.yml
```

### 2. Workflow Scripts

All scripts are located in `.adversarial/scripts/`:

- **evaluate_plan.sh** - Phase 1: Plan evaluation before implementation
- **review_implementation.sh** - Phase 3: Code review after implementation
- **validate_tests.sh** - Phase 4: Test validation and analysis

### 3. Typical Workflow

```bash
# Phase 1: Evaluate your plan
./.adversarial/scripts/evaluate_plan.sh tasks/TASK-001.md

# Phase 2: Implement (manual or with aider)
# ... make your changes ...

# Phase 3: Review implementation
./.adversarial/scripts/review_implementation.sh tasks/TASK-001.md

# Phase 4: Validate tests
./.adversarial/scripts/validate_tests.sh tasks/TASK-001.md

# Phase 5: Commit if approved
git add . && git commit -m "feat: Implement TASK-001"
```
