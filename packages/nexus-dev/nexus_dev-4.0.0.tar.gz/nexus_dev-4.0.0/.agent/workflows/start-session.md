description: Start a coding session with Nexus-Dev knowledge base

# Start Session Workflow

Use this workflow at the beginning of any coding session to load context from the knowledge base.

## Steps

1. Get project context to understand what's indexed:
   ```
   get_project_context()
   ```

2. If working on a specific area, search for relevant code:
   ```
   search_code("<feature or component name>")
   ```

3. Check for any relevant lessons from past debugging:
   ```
   search_lessons("<area you're working on>")
   ```

## When to Use

- At the start of any new coding session
- When switching to a different part of the codebase
- Before implementing a new feature
