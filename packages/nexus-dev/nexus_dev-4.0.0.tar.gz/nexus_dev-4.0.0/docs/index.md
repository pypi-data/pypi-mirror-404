# Nexus-Dev

**Persistent Memory for AI Coding Agents**

Nexus-Dev is an open-source MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides a local RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Windsurf. It learns from your codebase and mistakes, enabling cross-project knowledge sharing.

## ✨ Key Features

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :brain: **Persistent Memory**

    ---

    Index your code and documentation for semantic search. Your AI assistant remembers context across sessions.

-   :books: **Lesson Learning**

    ---

    Record problems and solutions. The AI recalls them when similar issues arise.

-   :octicons-mark-github-16: **GitHub Integration**

    ---

    Import Issues and Pull Requests into your knowledge base for context-aware assistance.

-   :globe_with_meridians: **Multi-Language Support**

    ---

    Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java - with extensibility via tree-sitter.

-   :arrows_counterclockwise: **Cross-Project Learning**

    ---

    Share knowledge across all your projects. Solutions from one project help others.

-   :house: **Local-First**

    ---

    All data stays on your machine with LanceDB. Privacy by default.
