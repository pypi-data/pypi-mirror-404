                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its

                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

  - This method queues the jobs for asynchronous submission and returns a mapping of futures to job IDs.
  - It does not wait for any of the jobs to complete.
  - Ensure that each job is in the proper state before submission.

- **Example**:
  ```python
  client.submit_job_async(job_id, "ingest_task_queue")
  ```

## Job Retrieval

### fetch_job_result

- **Description**: Fetches the job result from a message client, handling potential errors and state changes.
- **Method**: `fetch_job_result(job_id, timeout=10, data_only=True)`
- **Parameters**:
  - `job_id` (str): The identifier of the job.
  - `timeout` (float, optional): Timeout for the fetch operation in seconds. Defaults to 10.
  - `data_only` (bool, optional): If true, only returns the data part of the job result.
- **Returns**:
  - Tuple[Dict, str]: The job result and the job ID.
- **Raises**:
  - `ValueError`: If there is an error in decoding the job result.
  - `TimeoutError`: If the fetch operation times out.
  - `Exception`: For all other unexpected issues.

- **Example**:
  ```python
  job_id = client.add_job(job_spec)
  client.submit_job(job_id, TASK_QUEUE)
  generated_metadata = client.fetch_job_result(
      job_id, timeout=DEFAULT_JOB_TIMEOUT
  )
  ```

### fetch_job_result_async

- **Description**: Fetches job results for a list or a single job ID asynchronously and returns a mapping of futures to
  job IDs.
- **Method**: `fetch_job_result_async(job_ids, timeout=10, data_only=True)`
- **Parameters**:
  - `job_ids` (Union[str, List[str]]): A single job ID or a list of job IDs.
  - `timeout` (float, optional): Timeout for fetching each job result, in seconds. Defaults to 10.
  - `data_only` (bool, optional): Whether to return only the data part of the job result.
- **Returns**:
  - Dict[Future, str]: A dictionary mapping each future to its corresponding job ID.
- **Raises**:
  - No explicit exceptions raised but leverages the exceptions from `fetch_job_result`.

- **Example**:
  ```python
  job_id = client.add_job(job_spec)
  client.submit_job(job_id, TASK_QUEUE)
  generated_metadata = client.fetch_job_result_async(
      job_id, timeout=DEFAULT_JOB_TIMEOUT
  )
  ```

## Job and Task Management

    extract_tables_method="yolox",
  )
  job_spec.add_task(extract_task)
  job_id = client.add_job(job_spec)
  ```

### create_job

- **Description**: Creates a new job with specified parameters and adds it to the job tracking dictionary.
