## 0.2.1 - 2026-02-01

**Analysis Rigor & Inbox Workflow** - Enforces structured claim metadata and streamlines source processing.

This release introduces "rigor-v1" analysis tables with Layer/Actor/Scope/Quantifier columns, a new `--rigor` validation flag, and a complete inbox-to-reference filing workflow.

### Added

#### Analysis Rigor (v1)

- **Key Claims table** now includes Layer/Actor/Scope/Quantifier columns with column guide
- **Claim Summary table** updated with matching rigor columns
- **Corrections & Updates section** added to full-profile analyses for tracking source changes
- **`--rigor` flag** for `rc-validate` and `analysis_validator.py`:
  - WARN by default when rigor-v1 columns are missing
  - ERROR with `--rigor` flag for strict enforcement
- **Layer enum validation**: ASSERTED/LAWFUL/PRACTICED/EFFECT (N/A when genuinely inapplicable)

#### Evidence Links (rigor-v1 fields)

- `evidence_type`: LAW/REG/COURT_ORDER/FILING/MEMO/POLICY/REPORTING/VIDEO/DATA/STUDY/TESTIMONY/OTHER:\<text\>
- `claim_match`: How directly evidence supports the claim phrasing
- `court_posture`: stay/merits/preliminary_injunction/appeal/emergency/OTHER:\<text\>
- `court_voice`: majority/concurrence/dissent/per_curiam
- CLI: `rc-db evidence add --evidence-type LAW --court-posture merits --court-voice majority`

#### Reasoning Trails

- New statuses: `proposed` and `retracted` (in addition to active/superseded)
- CLI: `rc-db reasoning add --status proposed` for review workflows
- Validation enforces valid status values

#### Sources

- `last_checked` field for tracking when sources were last verified for changes
- CLI: `rc-db source update <id> --last-checked 2026-02-01`

#### Inbox Workflow

- **Filing guidance** in `/check` skill (Step 13: File Inbox)
- **Reference folder structure**:
  - `reference/primary/` - Primary documents renamed to source-id
  - `reference/captured/` - Supporting materials with original filenames
- **Generated .gitignore** includes rules for captured copyrighted content
- **WORKFLOWS.md** documents complete inbox processing flow

#### Project Structure

- `rc-db init-project` now creates `reference/primary/` and `reference/captured/`
- Simplified `inbox/` (single folder instead of subfolders)

### Changed

- `supersede_evidence_link()` now inherits rigor-v1 fields from old link
- Analysis formatter inserts Corrections & Updates section for full profile
- Skill templates updated with 16-step workflow (added File Inbox step)

### Fixed

- Layer validation allows N/A when genuinely inapplicable (documented)
- SCHEMA.md validation rules section updated for new statuses
- `validate.py` now enforces `REASONING_STATUS_INVALID` check

### Documentation

- `docs/WORKFLOWS.md`: New "Inbox Workflow" section with filing destinations

- `docs/SCHEMA.md`: Documented all new fields and status options
- `docs/TODO.md`: Analysis Rigor Improvements marked as ✅ Implemented

## 0.2.0 - 2026-01-31

**Epistemic Provenance** - A major feature release adding structured audit trails for claim credence assignments.

This release introduces two new database tables (`evidence_links` and `reasoning_trails`) that capture *why* claims are assigned particular credence values, enabling rigorous review, agent disagreement tracking, and full epistemic audit trails.

### Added

#### Evidence Links (`rc-db evidence`)
- Link claims to supporting/contradicting sources with explicit directionality
- Track evidence strength, location (e.g., "Table 3, p.15"), quotes, and reasoning
- Versioning support via `status` (active/superseded/retracted) and `supersedes_id`
- CLI commands: `evidence add`, `evidence get`, `evidence list`, `evidence supersede`

#### Reasoning Trails (`rc-db reasoning`)
- Document the full reasoning chain for credence assignments
- Capture credence/evidence-level at time of assessment
- Track supporting and contradicting evidence link references
- Structured counterarguments with dispositions (integrated/discounted/unresolved)
- Publishable `reasoning_text` field for human-readable rationales
- CLI commands: `reasoning add`, `reasoning get`, `reasoning list`, `reasoning history`

#### Validation
- High-credence claims (≥0.7) or strong evidence (E1/E2) now require:
  - At least one supporting evidence link (`HIGH_CREDENCE_NO_BACKING`)
  - At least one active reasoning trail (`HIGH_CREDENCE_NO_REASONING_TRAIL`)
- Staleness warnings when claim credence differs from latest reasoning trail
- Evidence link validation (claim/source refs, direction/status enums)
- Reasoning trail validation (evidence link refs, counterarguments schema)
- Use `--strict` to escalate warnings to errors

#### Export
- `rc-export md reasoning --id CLAIM-ID` - Per-claim reasoning docs with evidence tables
- `rc-export md reasoning --all --output-dir DIR` - Bulk export all claims with trails
- `rc-export md evidence-by-claim --id CLAIM-ID` - Evidence index for a claim
- `rc-export md evidence-by-source --id SOURCE-ID` - Evidence index for a source
- `rc-export provenance --format yaml|json` - Deterministic bulk provenance export

#### Documentation
- `docs/SCHEMA.md` updated with `evidence_links` and `reasoning_trails` tables
- `docs/WORKFLOWS.md` updated with Evidence Linking, Reasoning Trails, and Export Provenance sections
- `methodology/reasoning-trails.md` - Full provenance methodology and design philosophy

#### Migration
- `rc-db migrate` creates new tables automatically for existing databases
- `rc-db init-project` creates provenance directories (`analysis/reasoning/`, `analysis/evidence/`)

#### Integration Templates
- `/check` workflow updated with Step 9: Provenance for high-credence claims
- `partials/provenance-workflow.md.j2` - Reusable evidence linking section
- All integration skills regenerated (Claude, Codex, Amp, OpenCode)

### Changed

- `list_reasoning_trails()` now returns results sorted by `created_at` descending
- `get_reasoning_trail(claim_id=...)` returns the latest active trail (deterministic)
- Counterarguments field standardized on `text` (legacy `argument` still accepted)

### Fixed

- Validator/formatter now support markdown-linked claim IDs (`[ID](path)`)
- `--output-dir` added as alias for `-o/--output` in export CLI

## 0.1.9 - 2026-01-28

Added OpenCode integration with full skill support.

### Added

- OpenCode integration with 9 skills (check, search, validate, stats, analyze, extract, register, export, synthesize)
- OpenCode README and installation via `make install-skills-opencode`
- OpenCode section in main README

### Fixed

## 0.1.7 - 2026-01-26

Fixed package imports that broke pip-installed distributions.

### Fixed

- Package imports now work correctly when installed via pip (not just from source).
- Replaced fragile `sys.path.insert()` workarounds with proper `if __package__:` conditional imports in embed.py, export.py, migrate.py, and validate.py.
- Consolidated inline `usage_capture` imports in db.py that caused `ModuleNotFoundError`.

### Added

- `tests/test_installation.py`: 22 new tests verifying package imports, cross-module imports, CLI entry points, and package structure to catch installation issues before release.

## 0.1.6 - 2026-01-26

Re-release of 0.1.5 with corrected README (PyPI is immutable).

## 0.1.5 - 2026-01-26
