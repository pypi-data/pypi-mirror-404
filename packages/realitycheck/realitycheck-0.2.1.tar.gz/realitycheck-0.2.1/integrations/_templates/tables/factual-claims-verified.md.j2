### Key Factual Claims Verified

> **Requirement**: Must include >=1 **crux claim** (central to thesis), not just peripheral numerics.

| Claim (paraphrased) | Crux? | Source Says | Actual | External Source | Status |
|---------------------|-------|-------------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| [e.g., "China makes 50% of X"] | N | [assertion] | [verified value] | [URL/ref] | ok / x / ? |
| [e.g., "Elite consensus on Y"] | **Y** | [assertion] | [verified or ?] | [URL/ref] | ok / x / ? |

**Column guide**:
- **Claim**: Paraphrased factual claim from the source
- **Crux?**: Is this claim central to the argument? Mark crux claims with **Y**
- **Source Says**: What the source asserts
- **Actual**: What verification found (or `?` if unverified)
- **External Source**: URL or reference used for verification
- **Status**: `ok` = verified, `x` = refuted, `?` = unverified
