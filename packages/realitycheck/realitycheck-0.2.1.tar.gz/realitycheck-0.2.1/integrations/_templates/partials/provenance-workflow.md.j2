{#- Provenance workflow for evidence linking and reasoning capture -#}
## Epistemic Provenance (Optional but Recommended)

For high-credence claims (≥0.7) or strong evidence (E1/E2), capture the reasoning chain:

### 1. Link Evidence to Claims

Connect claims to their supporting/contradicting sources:

```bash
# Add evidence link
rc-db evidence add \
  --claim-id "DOMAIN-YYYY-NNN" \
  --source-id "source-id" \
  --direction supports \
  --strength 0.8 \
  --location "Table 3, p.15" \
  --reasoning "Direct measurement supports the claim"

# Directions: supports, contradicts, strengthens, weakens
```

### 2. Capture Reasoning Trails

Document why you assigned a particular credence:

```bash
rc-db reasoning add \
  --claim-id "DOMAIN-YYYY-NNN" \
  --credence 0.75 \
  --evidence-level E2 \
  --evidence-summary "E2 based on 2 supporting sources, 1 weak counter" \
  --supporting-evidence "EVLINK-2026-001,EVLINK-2026-002" \
  --contradicting-evidence "EVLINK-2026-003" \
  --reasoning-text "Assigned 0.75 because: (1) Two independent studies confirm X, (2) One methodologically weak study contradicts, discounted due to sample size issues"
```

### 3. Render Provenance Docs (Optional)

Export human-readable provenance for review:

```bash
# Single claim
rc-export md reasoning --id DOMAIN-YYYY-NNN -o analysis/reasoning/DOMAIN-YYYY-NNN.md

# All claims with trails
rc-export md reasoning --all --output-dir analysis/reasoning

# Evidence by source
rc-export md evidence-by-source --id source-id -o analysis/evidence/by-source/source-id.md
```

### When to Capture Provenance

- **Always** for claims with credence ≥ 0.7 (validation will warn if missing)
- **Always** for claims with E1/E2 evidence (high-quality evidence needs documented reasoning)
- **Recommended** for controversial or novel claims
- **Optional** for routine factual claims with obvious sourcing
