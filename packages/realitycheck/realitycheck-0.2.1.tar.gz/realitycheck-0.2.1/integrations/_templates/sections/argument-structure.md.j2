### Argument Structure

[Is this a chain argument? What's the logical flow?]

```
[Claim A]
    | implies
    v
[Claim B]
    | requires
    v
[Claim C]
    | leads to
    v
[Conclusion]
```

**Chain Analysis** (if applicable):
- **Weakest Link**: [Which step?]
- **Why Weak**: [Explanation]
- **If Link Breaks**: [What happens to conclusion?]
- **Alternative Paths**: [Can conclusion be reached differently?]
