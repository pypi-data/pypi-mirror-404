{#- Manual 3-Stage Analysis - without automatic database registration -#}

Perform a full 3-stage analysis following the Reality Check methodology. Use this for manual analysis when you want to review claims before registering them.

## Fetching Content

To retrieve and parse source content:
- Primary: `WebFetch` for most URLs
- Alternative: `curl -L -sS "URL" | rc-html-extract - --format json`
- `rc-html-extract` returns structured `{title, published, text, headings, word_count}`

## Methodology

### Stage 1: Descriptive Analysis
- Summarize the source neutrally
- Extract key claims, predictions, and assumptions
- Identify theoretical lineage (what traditions/thinkers it builds on)
- Map argument structure (chain arguments, logical flow)
- Note scope and domain (what does this attempt to explain?)
- Define key terms with operational proxies

### Stage 2: Evaluative Analysis
- Assess internal coherence and logical consistency
- Evaluate evidence quality using Evidence Hierarchy (E1-E6)
- Verify key factual claims (especially crux claims)
- Search for disconfirming evidence (5 min minimum)
- Check for internal tensions/self-contradictions
- Note persuasion techniques and rhetorical devices
- Identify unstated assumptions and dependencies
- Flag unfalsifiable claims

### Stage 3: Dialectical Analysis
- Steelman the strongest version of the argument
- Identify strongest counterarguments and counterfactuals
- Consider base rates and historical analogs
- Map relationships to other theories (supporting/contradicting)
- Synthesize: where does this fit in the broader landscape?

## Output

Generate:
1. Analysis document following the 3-stage methodology
2. Extracted claims formatted for database registration

**Rigor contract (v1)**:
- Claim tables should include `Layer`, `Actor`, `Scope`, and `Quantifier` fields (see `docs/WORKFLOWS.md` → “Analysis Rigor Contract (v1)”).
- Include a `Corrections & Updates` section (including capture failures and recency checks) for auditability.

After analysis, register manually:
```bash
rc-db source add --id "..." --title "..." --type "..." --author "..." --year YYYY --url "..."
rc-db claim add --id "..." --text "..." --type "[F]" --domain "..." --evidence-level "E2" --credence 0.XX --source-ids "..."
```

Or use `{{ invocation_prefix }}check` for fully automated analysis + registration.
