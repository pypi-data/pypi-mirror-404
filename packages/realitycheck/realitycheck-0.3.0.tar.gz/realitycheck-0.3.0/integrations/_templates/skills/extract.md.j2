{#- Quick Claim Extraction - fast extraction without full analysis -#}

Extract claims from a source without performing full 3-stage analysis. Use for quick claim harvesting or when sources are supporting evidence rather than primary subjects.

## When to Use

- Quick extraction of claims from supporting sources
- Building cross-reference evidence for existing claims
- Initial triage before deciding on full analysis
- Sources that are data-heavy rather than argument-heavy

## Output Format

```yaml
claims:
  - id: "DOMAIN-YYYY-NNN"
    text: "[Precise claim statement]"
    type: "[F/T/H/P/A/C/S/X]"
    domain: "[DOMAIN]"
    evidence_level: "E[1-6]"
    credence: 0.XX
    source_ids: ["[source-id]"]
```

## Notes

- Quick extractions should be labeled with `Analysis Depth: quick` in the analysis file
- Minimum requirements: Metadata, Legends, Claim Summary table, Claims YAML
- Full Stage 2 evaluation tables (verification, counterevidence, tensions, persuasion) are optional for quick extractions
- If a source proves more significant, upgrade to full analysis with `{{ invocation_prefix }}check --continue`
