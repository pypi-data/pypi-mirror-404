### Disconfirming Evidence Search

> For top 2-3 claims, actively search for counterevidence or alternative explanations (even 5 min changes behavior).

| Claim | Counterevidence Found | Alternative Explanation | Search Notes |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| [top claim 1] | [what contradicts it, or "none found"] | [other way to explain the data] | [what you searched] |
| [top claim 2] | [what contradicts it, or "none found"] | [other way to explain the data] | [what you searched] |
| [top claim 3] | [what contradicts it, or "none found"] | [other way to explain the data] | [what you searched] |

**Purpose**: Combat confirmation bias by explicitly searching for evidence against the source's claims.
