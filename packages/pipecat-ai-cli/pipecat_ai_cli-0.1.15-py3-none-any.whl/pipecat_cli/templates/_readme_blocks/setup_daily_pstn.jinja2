## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

2. Set up environment variables

   Copy the example file and fill in your API keys:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env with your API keys
    ```

3. Buy a phone number

   Instructions on how to do that can be found at this [docs link:](https://docs.daily.co/reference/rest-api/phone-numbers/buy-phone-number)

{% if daily_pstn_mode == 'dial-in' %}
4. Set up the dial-in config

   Instructions on how to do that can be found at this [docs link](https://docs.daily.co/reference/rest-api/domainDialinConfig).

   The `room_creation_api` should point to your webhook endpoint. For local testing with ngrok, this will be:

   ```
   https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/daily-dialin-webhook
   ```

   > Tip: If you're using Pipecat Cloud, you can purchase a number using the Pipecat Cloud dashboard (Settings > Telephony).
{% else %}
4. Request dial-out enablement

   For compliance reasons, to enable dial-out for your Daily account, you must request enablement via the form. You can find out more about dial-out, and the form at the [link here](https://docs.daily.co/guides/products/dial-in-dial-out#main)

{% endif %}
{% if daily_pstn_mode == 'dial-out' %}
## Environment Configuration

The bot supports two deployment modes controlled by the `ENV` variable:

### Local Development (`ENV=local`)

- Uses your local server for handling dial-out requests and starting the bot
- Default configuration for development and testing

### Production (`ENV=production`)

- Bot is deployed to Pipecat Cloud; requires `PIPECAT_API_KEY` and `PIPECAT_AGENT_NAME`
- Set these when deploying to production environments
- Your FastAPI server runs either locally or deployed to your infrastructure

{% endif %}

## Run the Bot Locally

{% if daily_pstn_mode == 'dial-in' %}
You'll need two terminal windows open:

1. Terminal 1: Start the webhook server:

   ```bash
   uv run server.py
   ```

2. Terminal 2: Start an ngrok tunnel to expose the FastAPI server running on server.py

   ```bash
   ngrok http 7860
   ```

   Important: Make sure that this URL matches the `room_creation_api` URL for your phone number.

   > Tip: Use the `--subdomain` for a reusable ngrok link.

3. Configure your Daily phone number

   Set your phone number's `room_creation_api` webhook to:

   ```
   https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/daily-dialin-webhook
   ```

   Instructions: [Daily Dial-in Config Docs](https://docs.daily.co/reference/rest-api/domainDialinConfig)

   > If you're using Pipecat Cloud, you can configure your phone number's webhook in the Pipecat Cloud dashboard (Settings > Telephony).

4. Call your bot!

   Call the number you configured to talk to your bot.
{% else %}
You'll need two terminal windows open:

1. **Terminal 1**: Start the webhook server:

   ```bash
   uv run server.py
   ```

   This runs on port 8080 and handles dial-out requests.

2. **Terminal 2**: Start the bot server:

   ```bash
   uv run bot.py -t daily
   ```

   This runs on port 7860 and handles the bot logic.

3. **Test the dial-out functionality**

   With both servers running, send a dial-out request:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/dialout" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "dialout_settings": {
         "phone_number": "+1234567890"
       }
     }'
   ```

   The server will create a room, start the bot, and the bot will call the specified number. Answer the call to speak with the bot.
