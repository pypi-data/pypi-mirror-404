## How It Works

{% if daily_pstn_mode == 'dial-in' %}
1. Daily receives an incoming call to your phone number
2. Daily calls your webhook server (`/daily-dialin-webhook` endpoint, included in the bundled Pipecat development runner)
3. The webhook server creates a Daily room with SIP configuration
4. The webhook server starts your bot with the room details and caller information
5. The caller is put on hold with music
6. The bot joins the Daily room and signals readiness
7. Daily forwards the call to the Daily room
8. The caller and bot are connected for the conversation

> Note: When deploying to Pipecat Cloud, steps 1-4 are handled by the Pipecat Cloud service.

{% elif daily_pstn_mode == 'dial-out' %}
1. Your application triggers an outbound call
2. The bot creates a Daily room with dial-out capabilities
3. Daily initiates the outbound call to the specified phone number
4. When the call is answered, the bot joins the Daily room
5. The bot and the callee are connected, and the bot handles the conversation
