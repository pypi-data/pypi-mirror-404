Run AI models anywhere.

## Installing Muna
Muna is distributed on PyPi. This distribution contains both the Python client and the command line interface (CLI). Run the following command in terminal:
```sh
# Install Muna
$ pip install --upgrade muna
```

> [!NOTE]
> Muna requires Python 3.11+

## Transpiling a Python Function
Muna can transpile Python functions into C++, generating a self-contained header-only library that pulls all of its dependencies automatically (e.g. llama.cpp, mlx, CUDA). First, add the [`@compile`](https://docs.muna.ai/predictors/create) decorator to your function:
```py
from muna import compile

@compile()
def do_stuff():
    ...
```

Then use the Muna CLI to transpile to C++:
```sh
# Transpile the Python function to C++
$ muna transpile do_stuff.py
```

Muna will create a cloud sandbox to setup your Python function, trace it, lower to C++, then generate a folder containing the header-only library and a corresponding `CMakeLists.txt`.

> [!TIP]
> Even though the compiler is not open-source, you can [read up on how it works](https://blog.codingconfessions.com/p/compiling-python-to-run-anywhere).

Once compiled, you can then build the included example app and test it from the command line. Here's an example using
