# Novel Observing Strategies Testbed (NOS-T)

The Novel Observing Strategies Testbed (NOS-T) is a computational testbed for
maturing technologies related to the NASA Novel Observing Strategies thrust.

Documentation: https://nost-tools.readthedocs.io

## NOS-T Tools Installation

NOS-T tools is a collection of tools for the Novel Observing Strategies Testbed
(NOS-T). Installing `nost-tools` as an editable Python library requires `pip`
version 23 or greater (install via `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`).

To install `nost-tools`, run the following command from the project root
directory:

```
pip install -e .
```

Alternatively, to install supplemental libraries required for examples, run

```
pip install -e .[examples]
```
