# PyTrain API

This project implements a RESTful API to [PyTrain](https://github.com/cdswindell/PyLegacy). Via the API, you can
control and operate trains, switches, accessories, and any other equipment that uses Lionel's Legacy/TMCC command
protocol. **PyTrain Api** is used by the **PyTrain** Alexa skill to enable voice-control of your layout.

**PyTrain Api** is developed in pure Python. It uses the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) framework and
includes an ASGI-compliant web server, [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org). Once installed, it only takes one
command to launch the **PyTrain Api** and begin serving requests.

**PyTrain Api** runs as a **PyTrain** client connected to another **PyTrain** server, or can act as both
a **PyTrain** server _and_ a **PyTrain Api** server. And, like **PyTrain**, **PyTrain Api** can run on a Raspberry Pi
running 64-bit Bookworm distribution or later.

The **PyTrain Api** endpoints can be viewed

## Quick Start

### Requirements

Minimum requirements to use **PyTrain API** are:

* A Lionel Base 3 running the most current Lionel firmware and configured in *infrastructure* mode
* A network-capable Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 running Raspberry PI OS 64-bit Bookworm
* A Mac or Windows computer to set up the Raspberry Pi(s)
* All hardware connected to the same Wi-Fi network
* Python 3.10–3.12 installed (Python 3.11 is standard with the Bookworm release of Raspberry Pi OS)
* Internet access (to download software)

Recommended:

* A **PyTrain** server running on a separate Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 Wi-Fi-equipped computer with at least 2 GB
  of RAM running Raspberry PI OS 64-bit Bookworm

Notes:

* It is recommended to have a Lionel LCS Ser2 module connected to your **PyTrain** server, as
  the Lionel Base 3 **_does not_** broadcast all layout activity
* **PyTrain** is a command-line tool. It must be run from a Terminal window (macOS/Linux/Pi) or a Cmd
  shell (Windows). **PyTrain** does _not_ have a GUI nor run as a native app.
* **PyTrain** _may_ work with an LCS Wi-Fi module, but this configuration hasn't been tested
* The **PyTrain** CLI can be run on a Mac or Windows system. It allows complete control of _all_ TMCC or
  Legacy-equipped devices as well as allows you to monitor all TMCC and Legacy commands

### Installation

**PyTrain Api** can be run directly from a Python virtual environment or
from a **PyTrain Api** development environment, The former is preferable if you do not plan
on changing the **PyTrain Api** code itself. Both methods require the creation of a
Python [virtual environment](https://developer.vonage.com/en/blog/a-comprehensive-guide-on-working-with-python-virtual-environments#using-venv).

#### Create a Python Virtual Environment

* Open a Terminal shell window and navigate to the folder/directory where
  you will install __PyTrain Api__
* Create a virtual environment with the command:

```aiignore
python3 -m venv PyTrainApiEnv
```

* In the same terminal window, `cd` into the directory you created above and activate the environment:

```aiignore
cd PyTrainApiEnv
source bin/activate
```

#### Run __PyTrain Api__ Directly

* Use `pip` to install the __PyTrain Api__ package from `pypi`:

```aiignore
pip3 install pytrain-ogr-api
```

* Run the __PyTrain Api__ server:

```aiignore
pytrain_api
```

This command launches a webserver that accepts requests on port `8000`and connects to a __PyTrain__ server.
To see the list of available Api endpoints, open a web browser and go to `http://<your local IP>:8000/pytrain`.

#### Run __PyTrain Api__ from a Development Environment

* In the same terminal window where you created the virtual environment, `cd` into the directory you
  created above and download the __PyTrain Api__ source code (this assumes you have installed
  the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com)):

```aiignore
gh repo clone cdswindell/PyTrainApi
```

* `cd` into the directory `PyTrainApi` and activate the environment:

```aiignore
cd PyTrainApi
source ../bin/activate
```

* Install the __PyTrain Api__ required packages:

```aiignore
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

* Run the __PyTrain Api__ server:

```aiignore
cli/pytrain_api
```

This command launches a webserver that accepts requests on port `8000`and connects to a __PyTrain__ server.
To see the list of available Api endpoints, open a web browser and go to `http://<your local IP>:8000/pytrain`.

### Configuration

The **PyTrain Api** endpoints are all protected against unintentional as well as unwanted access. It does so by
requiring an *api token* to be present in the header of each request. Modern programming languages make this
easy to do.

Api tokens should be kept secure, just like the key to your house, otherwise, anyone could learn and use it.
For this reason, ypu must generate the required keys yourself and keep them in a special file, the `.env` file.
This file must be placed in the same directory you run the **PyTrain Api** program from.

**PyTrain Api** provides a special command to generate a correctly-configured `.env` file and populate it
with an api token for your own use. To do so, `cd` to the directory where you plan to run the Api and type:

- Run **PyTrain Api** Directly

```aiignore
pytrin_api -env
```

- Run **PyTrain Api** from a Development Environment

```aiignore
cli/pytrin_api -env
```

Use the value assigned to the tag `API_TOKEN` as your secure **PyTrain Api** token. Include it in
your request header with the tag `X-API-Key`, and you will be good to go. Below is an example of how to do
this from Python:

```aiignore
headers = {"X-API-Key": "<Replace with the API_TOKEN from .env file>"}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers)
```

You *should not* modify any values in `.env` unless you are using the [Alexa Skill](#alexa-skill) (see below).
Changing other values will
break **PyTrain Api**. If you do mistakenly modify the file's contents or delete it, you can
regenerate it using the appropriate command above.

## Alexa Skill

__PyTrain Api__ is required to use the Alexa __PyTrain__ skill. You may install __PyTrain Api__
using either method described above.

### Configuration

Before getting into the configuration details, let's look at the moving parts involved:

1. Your Lionel Base 3. This device is connected to your local network and receives commands from a Cab 2, Cab 3,
   and/or **PyTrain** server. These commands are relayed onto your layout to control your equipment.

2. Your local network. This can be completely wireless or a hybrid of wired and wireless devices.

3. Your **PyTrain API** server. This is a computer on your local network where you have installed **PyTrain API**.
   It takes requests from the web in a specific format (HTTP or HTTPS) and relays them to your **PyTrain** server.
   **PyTrain API** can run on one of your existing computers (Mac or Windows), or, and a small, inexpensive
   [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com).

4. Your **PyTrain** server. This is another computer on your local network where you have installed
   [**PyTrain**](https://pypi.org/project/pytrain-ogr/). **PyTrain** receives requests from **PyTrain API**
   and relays them to your Lionel Base 3 in the format it requires. It can also take input from a command
   line (CLI) or be embedded into one or more control panels to operate your layout via physical buttons,
   lights, dials, and knobs. It should run its own [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com).

5. An [Alexa](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=alexa&crid=7OAPBGIW11Q4&sprefix=alexa%2Caps%2C107&ref=nb_sb_noss_1).
   This device is a wireless speaker and microphone. It supports *skills*, which are voice-activated apps
   that run on Alexa-enabled devices. You can use Alexa skills to perform tasks like telling jokes,
   getting weather updates, or controlling your Lionel layout. It connects to your local network.

6. Your Gateway. This device connects your local network to *the internet*. It may have been provided by
   your Internet Service Provider (ISP), or you may have purchased it yourself. It is the bridge that lets devices
   on your local network talk to the internet and lets the internet talk to devices on your local network,
   like your Lionel Base 3.

7. Amazon AWS. Amazon runs several large computing facilities around the world. Alexa skills send the voice
   input from your local alexa's to these computers to interpret, then execute software to fulfill your requests. The
   **PyTrain** Alexa skill, which is named *My Layout*, runs on these computers, takes your voice input and then calls
   back to the
   **PyTrain API**
   on your local network to control your layout.

Phew! Although there are a lot of moving parts, getting everything up and running is straightforward,
thanks to the **PyTrain** software.

Here is what you need to do:

1. Configure two Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 computers. Units with Wi-Fi are preferred, as there are fewer wires.
2. Install **PyTrain** on one of them and start it with the command:

```aiignore
pytrain -base <ip address of your Lionel Base 3>
```

If you have a Lionel Lcs Ser2, connect it to this computer and start **PyTrain** with this command:

```aiignore
pytrain -ser -base <ip address of your Lionel Base 3>
```

3. Install **PyTrain Api** on the other Raspberry Pi (using one of the two methods above) and start
   it with the appropriate command:

```aiignore
pytrain_api 

or

cli/pytrain_api
```

**PyTrain Api** will automatically find and connect to your **PyTrain** server.

4. Go to your gateway and determine its *external* IP address. This address is assigned by your ISP
   (Comcast, Verizon, Spectrum, etc.). Write it down.
5. Consult your gateway documentation on how to forward port 80 to port 8000 on your **PyTrain API** server.
   This will send all traffic from the outside world to port 8000 on your **PyTrain Api** server. You will need
   to repeat this step any time your external IP address changes (see Notes below).
6. Say the following to your Alexa: *Alexa, Open My Layout*
7. The *PyTrain* skill will ask you for the external IP address of your network. Give it the number
   you wrote down above.

Your **PyTrain** skill is now active and connected to your layout. To test it out, assuming you have an
engine on the tracks with TMCC ID 67, try the following:

* Ask My Layout to start up engine 67
* Blow the horn on engine 67
* toggle the bell on engine 67
* accelerate engine 67 to speed step 10
* stop engine 67
* shut down engine 67 with dialog

As long as you see the *blue light* on your Alexa, the **PyTrain** *My Layout* skill is listening. If the light goes
out, say:
*Alexa, Open My Layout*, and speak your request.

Notes:

* If your gateway supports Dynamic DNS, you can assign a *domain name* to your external network, and your gateway will
  automatically update it with your external IP address, should your ISP change it.
  [Netgear](https://kb.netgear.com/23860/How-do-I-set-up-a-NETGEAR-Dynamic-DNS-account-on-my-NETGEAR-router),
  [No-ip.com](https://www.noip.com), and [Dyn.com](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/networking/dns/?er=221886)
  all provide dynamic dns services at a reasonable cost.

### Additional Security

For additional security, you can configure an HTTPS server to proxy requests from the Alexa skill
to the system running __PyTrain API__. This requires:

* Install an additional web server that supports HTTPS secure communication.
  The [nginx](https://nginx.org) web server is an excellent candidate.
* Configure `ngnix` to proxy HTTPS requests from port 443 to port 8000, where they are processed by __PyTrain API__.
* Install an SSL certificate on your dynamic dns service
* Configure the certificate and private key on your local proxy server.

These steps are not required but are suggested if you leave your layout unattended and powered on
to prevent unwanted access.
