Client state machine for managing connection lifecycle.

This module provides a state machine for tracking client connection states
with validated transitions and event emission.

The state machine ensures:
- Only valid state transitions occur
- State changes are logged for debugging
- Invalid transitions raise exceptions for early error detection
