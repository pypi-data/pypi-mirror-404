Calculated (derived) data points for AioHomematic.

This subpackage provides data points whose values are computed from one or more
underlying device data points. Typical examples include climate-related metrics
(such as dew point, apparent temperature, frost point, vapor concentration) and
battery/voltage related assessments (such as operating voltage level).

How it works:
- Each calculated data point is a lightweight model that subscribes to one or
  more generic data points of a channel and recomputes its value when any of
  the source data points change.
- Relevance is determined per channel. A calculated data point class exposes an
  "is_relevant_for_model" method that decides if the channel provides the
  necessary inputs.
- Creation is handled centrally via the factory function below.

Factory:
- create_calculated_data_points(channel): Iterates over the known calculated
  implementations, checks their relevance against the given channel, and, if
  applicable, creates and attaches instances to the channel so they behave like
  normal read-only data points.

Modules/classes:
- ApparentTemperature, DewPoint, DewPointSpread, Enthalphy, FrostPoint, VaporConcentration: Climate-related
  sensors implemented in climate.py using well-known formulas (see
  aiohomematic.model.calculated.support for details and references).
- OperatingVoltageLevel: Interprets battery/voltage values and exposes a human
  readable operating level classification.

These calculated data points complement generic and custom data points by
exposing useful metrics not directly provided by the device/firmware.
