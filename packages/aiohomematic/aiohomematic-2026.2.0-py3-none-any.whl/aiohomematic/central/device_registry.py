Device registry for managing device and channel collections.

This module provides a centralized registry for device management within the central unit.
It separates device storage concerns from device lifecycle management.

The DeviceRegistry provides:
- Device storage and lookup by address
- Channel lookup by channel address
- Device iteration and filtering
- Channel identification within text
- Virtual remote device access
