"""Address nickname setup utilities.

This module provides functions to assign human-readable nicknames to
important on-chain addresses (e.g., Zero Address, Disperse.app, tokens).
It is used at package initialization to ensure all analytics and dashboards
display professional, consistent labels.

Key Responsibilities:
    - Set nicknames for core addresses in the database.
    - Integrate with constants and token metadata.
    - Support professional, readable analytics outputs.

This is called automatically on package import.
