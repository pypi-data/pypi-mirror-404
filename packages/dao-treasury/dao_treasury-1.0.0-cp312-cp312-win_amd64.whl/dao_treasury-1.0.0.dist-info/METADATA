DAO Treasury is a comprehensive financial reporting and treasury management solution designed specifically for decentralized organizations. Built as an extension to [eth-portfolio](https://github.com/BobTheBuidler/eth-portfolio)'s [Portfolio Exporter](https://bobthebuidler.github.io/eth-portfolio/exporter.html), DAO Treasury automates the collection and visualization of financial data, enabling organizations to monitor and report on treasury activities with clarity and transparency.

## Key Features

- **Financial Reporting for DAOs:** Extends core portfolio functionalities to generate detailed reports tailored for on-chain organizations.
- **Dashboard Provisioning:** Utilizes [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboards—defined in JSON files within the .grafana/provisioning directories—to offer real-time, dynamic visualizations of treasury data.
- **Automated Data Export:** Features a treasury export tool that, once configured (with a supported [brownie network](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/network-management.html) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)), continuously captures financial snapshots at set intervals.
- **Custom Buckets for Wallets:** Assign custom categories ("buckets") to specific wallet addresses for more granular reporting using the `--custom-bucket` CLI option.
- **Ease of Contribution:** Non-technical users can easily update or create dashboard visuals using Grafana’s intuitive UI. The [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/BobTheBuidler/dao-treasury/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document provides a step-by-step guide to defining new visuals and dashboards and integrating those changes into the repository, ensuring that anyone can contribute to the visual reporting aspect of the project.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10 or higher.
- At least 16GB of RAM.
- All dependencies installed as specified in the project’s pyproject.toml file.

## Prerequisites

- First, you will need to bring your own archive node. This can be one you run yourself, or one from one of the common providers (Tenderly, Alchemy, QuickNode, etc.). Your archive node must have tracing enabled (free-tier Alchemy nodes do not support this option).
- You must configure a [brownie network](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/network-management.html) to use your RPC.
- You will need an auth token for [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)'s API. Follow their [guide](https://docs.etherscan.io/etherscan-v2/getting-an-api-key) to get your key, and set env var `ETHERSCAN_TOKEN` with its value.
- You'll also need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) installed on your system. If on MacOS, you will need to leave Docker Desktop open while DAO Treasury is running.

## Debug logging
DAO Treasury relies on ypricemagic for price lookups. If you need to spot long-running price calls, enable the `y.stuck?` logger at DEBUG. Details: [y.stuck? logger](CONTRIBUTING.md#y-stuck-logger).

## Installation

```bash
pip install dao-treasury
```

## Usage

Run the treasury export tool:

```bash
# For pip installations:
dao-treasury run --wallet 0x123 --network mainnet --interval 12h
```

For local development (from source installation), use:
```bash
poetry run dao-treasury run --wallet 0x123 --network mainnet --interval 12h
```

**Assigning Custom Buckets to Wallets:**

You can assign custom categories ("buckets") to specific wallet addresses for more granular reporting. Use the `--custom-bucket` option one or more times, each with the format `address:bucket_name`:

```bash
dao-treasury run --wallet 0x123 --network mainnet --custom-bucket "0x123:Operations" --custom-bucket "0x456:Grants" --custom-bucket "0x789:Investments"
```

**CLI Options:**
> Only optional arguments are listed here. Required arguments (such as `--wallet` or `--wallets`) are shown in the usage examples above.

- `--network`: The id of the brownie network the exporter will connect to (default: mainnet)
- `--interval`: The time interval between each data snapshot (default: 12h)
- `--concurrency`: The max number of historical blocks to export concurrently. (default: 30)
- `--daemon`: Run the export process in the background (default: False) (NOTE: currently unsupported)
- `--sort-rules`: Directory containing sort rules definitions for transaction categorization.
- `--nicknames`: File containing address nicknames for reporting.
- `--grafana-port`: Set the port for the Grafana dashboard where you can view data (default: 3004)
- `--renderer-port`: Set the port for the report rendering service (default: 8091)
- `--victoria-port`: Set the port for the Victoria metrics reporting endpoint (default: 8430)
- `--start-renderer`: If set, both the Grafana and renderer containers will be started for dashboard image export. By default, only the grafana container is started.
- `--custom-bucket`: Assign a custom bucket/category to a wallet address for reporting. Specify as `address:bucket_name`. Can be used multiple times.

After running the command, the export script will run continuously until you close your terminal.
To view the dashboards, open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3004](http://localhost:3004). Log in with the Grafana admin credentials you set via `GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER` and `GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (or enable anonymous access with `DAO_TREASURY_GRAFANA_ANON_ENABLED=true`).

## Docker

When you run DAO Treasury, [eth-portfolio](https://github.com/BobTheBuidler/eth-portfolio) will build and start 4 [required Docker containers](https://bobthebuidler.github.io/eth-portfolio/exporter.html#docker-containers) on your system. Additionally, DAO Treasury will build and start 2 more required containers:

- **grafana**
  - Provides a web-based dashboard for visualizing your treasury data.
  - Pre-configured with dashboards and plugins for real-time monitoring.
  - Uses persistent storage to retain dashboard settings and data.
  - Accessible locally (default port `3004`, configurable via `--grafana-port`).
  - Requires login by default using `GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER` and `GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
  - Optional anonymous access via `DAO_TREASURY_GRAFANA_ANON_ENABLED=true` (Viewer-only).
  - Sign-ups are disabled for safety.
  - Validates admin credentials on startup and fails fast if they are incorrect.
  - Integrates with the renderer container for dashboard image export.
  - Loads dashboards and data sources automatically via provisioning files.

- **renderer**
  - Runs the official Grafana image renderer service.
  - Enables Grafana to export dashboards as images for reporting or sharing.
  - Operates on port `8091` by default (configurable via `--renderer-port`).
  - Tightly integrated with the Grafana container for seamless image rendering.
  - **Note:** The renderer container is only started if you pass the `--start-renderer` CLI flag.

**How it works:**
1. DAO Treasury collects and exports treasury data.
2. Grafana displays this data in pre-built dashboards for analysis and reporting.
3. The renderer container allows dashboards to be exported as images directly from Grafana (if enabled).

**Additional Information:**
- All containers are orchestrated via Docker Compose and started automatically as needed.
- Grafana provisioning ensures dashboards and data sources are set up out-of-the-box.
- All dashboard data and settings are persisted for durability.
- Dashboard images can be generated for reporting via the renderer (if enabled).
