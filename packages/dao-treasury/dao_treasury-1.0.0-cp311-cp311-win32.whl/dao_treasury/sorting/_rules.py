class Rules:
    """Loader for transaction‐sorting rule matchers defined in YAML files.

    This class discovers and instantiates matchers based on simple YAML definitions
    organized under subdirectories for each top‐level category in a given base path.

    The expected directory layout is:

        base_path/
            revenue/
            cost_of_revenue/
            expenses/
            other_income/
            other_expense/
            ignore/

    Under each category directory, files named `match_on_hash.(yml|yaml)`,
    `match_on_from_address.(yml|yaml)`, and `match_on_to_address.(yml|yaml)`
    define mappings of subgroup names to lists or nested dicts of values keyed by
    the active chain ID.

    Upon initialization, all available matchers are built exactly once and registered
    in the global in‐memory registry, allowing transactions to be routed to the
    appropriate `TxGroup` by hash, sender address, or recipient address.

    Examples:
        >>> from pathlib import Path
        >>> from dao_treasury.sorting._rules import Rules
        >>> rules = Rules(Path("config/sorting_rules"))
        # If config/sorting_rules/revenue/match_on_hash.yml contains:
        #   1:
        #     DonationReceived:
        #       - 0xabc123...
        # Then this creates a `TxGroup` named "Revenue:DonationReceived"
        # and a `HashMatcher` that routes hash "0xabc123..." accordingly.
