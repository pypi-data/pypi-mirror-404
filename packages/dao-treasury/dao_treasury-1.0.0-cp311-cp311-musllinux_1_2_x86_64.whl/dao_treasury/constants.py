"""Core constants for DAO Treasury.

All constants are marked with `Final`, ensuring immutability and allowing
mypyc to compile them as extremely fast C-level constants for maximum
performance. Defines chain IDs, zero address, and key contract addresses
(e.g., Disperse.app) used throughout the system for transaction processing,
nickname assignment, and analytics.

Key Responsibilities:
    - Provide canonical addresses and chain IDs.
    - Support nickname setup and transaction categorization.
    - Guarantee fast, immutable constants at runtime.

This is the single source of truth for system-wide constants.
