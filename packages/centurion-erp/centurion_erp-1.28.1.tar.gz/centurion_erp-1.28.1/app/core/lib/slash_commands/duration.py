after the command, is `<digit>` then either `h`, `m`, `s` for hours, minutes and seconds respectively.

Valid commands are as follows:

- /spend 1h1ms

- /spend 1h 1m 1s

For this command to process the following conditions must be met:

- There is a `<new line>` (`\\n`) char immediatly before the slash `/`

- There is a `<space>` char after the command keyword, i.e. `/spend<space>1h`

- _Optional_ `<space>` char between the time blocks.
