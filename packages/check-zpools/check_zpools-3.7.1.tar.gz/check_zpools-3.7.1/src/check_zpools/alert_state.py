"""Alert state management for deduplication and suppression.

Purpose
-------
Track which alerts have been sent and when, to prevent alert fatigue through
intelligent deduplication and resend throttling. State persists across daemon
restarts in a JSON file.

Contents
--------
* :class:`AlertState` - dataclass representing the state of a single alert
* :class:`AlertStateManager` - manages alert suppression and persistence

Architecture
------------
The manager maintains a dictionary of alert states keyed by pool name and
issue category. It determines whether an alert should be sent based on:
1. Whether this is a new issue (never seen before)
2. Whether enough time has passed since the last alert (resend interval)
3. Whether the issue has been resolved

State is persisted to a JSON file in a platform-specific cache directory.
