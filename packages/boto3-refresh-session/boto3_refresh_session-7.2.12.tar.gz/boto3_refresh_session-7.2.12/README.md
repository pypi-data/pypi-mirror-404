## Recognition and Testimonials

[Featured in TL;DR Sec.](https://tldrsec.com/p/tldr-sec-282)

[Featured in CloudSecList.](https://cloudseclist.com/issues/issue-290)

Recognized during AWS Community Day Midwest on June 5th, 2025 (the founder's birthday!).

A testimonial from a Cyber Security Engineer at a FAANG company:

> _Most of my work is on tooling related to AWS security, so I'm pretty choosy about boto3 credentials-adjacent code. I often opt to just write this sort of thing myself so I at least know that I can reason about it. But I found boto3-refresh-session to be very clean and intuitive [...] We're using the RefreshableSession class as part of a client cache construct [...] We're using AWS Lambda to perform lots of operations across several regions in hundreds of accounts, over and over again, all day every day. And it turns out that there's a surprising amount of overhead to creating boto3 clients (mostly deserializing service definition json), so we can run MUCH more efficiently if we keep a cache of clients, all equipped with automatically refreshing sessions._

## Installation
