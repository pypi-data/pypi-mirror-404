Below is a **high-leverage, novel, and atypical** playbook tailored to *Pomera-AI-Commander*—a niche but very “hookable” project (AI agent + TUI + CLI + workflow automation + hardware-ish vibe). The idea is to **differentiate**, not just broadcast.

---

# 🚀 **1. Positioning First: Turn Your Project Into a “Movement”**

Most GitHub projects fail not because of code quality but because they have no *identity*.
Here are three positioning angles that make Pomera-AI-Commander uniquely memorable:

### **A. “Bring Back Computing” Movement**

Lean into retro-TUI / minimalism nostalgia:

> *A movement for distraction-free AI workflows—modern smarts, retro discipline.*

Great for communities that hate bloated tools.

### **B. “AI Terminal Productivity Superpower”**

Developers love terminal-first automation. Position as the “Raycast for terminals” but AI-native.

### **C. “First Agentic AI that Actually Belongs in the Shell”**

This is a unique differentiator—most AI tools are GUI-heavy.

**Once positioned**, every outreach message feels intentional rather than self-promo.

---

# 🌐 **2. Atypical Places to Promote (Most People Ignore These)**

## **A. Hacker News *Show HN* with a Twist**

Do NOT post “Here’s my GitHub repo.”
Instead post:

> **Show HN: A Retro-Inspired AI Command Console for People Who Miss Real Computing**

This framing consistently jumps to top 10.

---

## **B. /r/CommandLine & /r/TUI & /r/unixporn**

High-ROI, enthusiastic users who *love* terminal UI frameworks (Bubble Tea, Charmbracelet).

**Novel tactic:**
Create a **cinematic GIF demo** using vhs (Charmbracelet tool).
Post that GIF as the headline item—these subs love visuals over text.

---

## **C. Post a “Developer Challenge”**

Example:

> **$100 Bounty: Build the Coolest Plugin for Pomera-AI-Commander. Winner gets featured.**

You don’t even need a big reward—people rush toward gamified coding tasks.

Promote this in:

* /r/hackathon
* /r/coding
* /r/python
* /r/javascript
* Indie Hackers
* ProductHunt Makers Group

---

## **D. Add it to “Awesome Lists” (the underrated hack)**

Submit PRs to:

* **awesome-ai-agents**
* **awesome-cli-apps**
* **awesome-tuis**
* **awesome-python**
* **awesome-nodejs**
* **awesome-productivity**
* **awesome-raycast-like-tools**

Each list adds long-term discovery traffic.

---

## **E. Niche Forums No One Uses for AI Tools**

These give top-tier traffic because they are *not saturated*:

* **Lobsters** (high dev quality)
* **Dev.to** (writing post: “Reinventing AI Interactions with TUIs”)
* **Replit community**
* **Neovim discourse** (“AI inside your terminal workflow”)
* **Obsidian community** (knowledge-workers love text-centric AI tools)
* **Zellij/WezTerm/Kitty communities** (terminal enhancement ecosystems)

---

## **F. Sponsor a Low-Cost Newsletter**

### Best candidates:

* **Console.dev** (~$300–$500 placement, VERY high dev conversion)
* **This Week in Rust / Python / Node**
* **Tilde News** (retro computing vibes → perfect for your project)
* **Data Engineering Weekly** (AI + automation crowd)

A single mention can bring 1–3k GitHub stars.

---

# 🧪 **3. Unusual, High-Impact Strategies Most People Never Try**

## **A. Create a Public “AI Workflow Cookbook”**

People don’t star projects—they star *examples*.
Make:

* 10–20 “recipes”
* Screenshots/GIFs
* Pydoc + npm examples
* Real-world workflows

Think:

* “How to turn Pomera into your daily journal AI assistant”
* “How to auto-summarize YouTube into markdown in a TUI”
* “How to build agentic shell tasks quickly”

Then publish the cookbook on:

* Medium
* Dev.to
* GitHub Pages
* Hacker News

---

## **B. Turn Your README Into an Interactive Terminal**

Use tools like:

* **asciinema + SVG embed**
* **Charmbracelet VHS (scripted terminal demo)**

When users *see it running*, your conversion rate doubles.

---

## **C. Add a Physical Artifact**

This may sound strange, but it *works*:

Create a **retro terminal sticker** (fake Pomera Commander badge).

Then post on Twitter/X:

> “Want one of these stickers?
> Star Pomera-AI-Commander + comment below.”

People LOVE stickers. It’s dumb but effective. This grows repos by 100–500 stars fast.

---

## **D. Submit to the *weird* software directories**

These are gold mines:

* **Kagi Small Web**
* **Kagi Universal Index**
* **Indiepages**
* **Stacks (stackdiary.com/new-tools)**
* **Similarium**

Most of these love niche, artisanal tools.

---

## **E. Viral “Before vs After Pomera” Screenshots**

Like:

**Before:** messy browser tabs
**After:** clean TUI with AI automations

This resonates deeply.

---

## **F. Build a “Plugin Marketplace” Early**

Even if it's tiny, having an extensible ecosystem signals longevity.

Create:

`pomera-commander-plugins/` organization

Seed it with **3–4 example plugins**.

Developers flock to ecosystems, not repos.

---

## **G. Offer “First 10 Contributors Get Founder Perks”**

This creates psychological scarcity.

---

# 🎯 **4. Places Where You *Can* Pay for Ads (but only if smart)**

## **A. X/Twitter targeted ads (dev interest + AI agents)**

These are surprisingly cheap (~$6–$15 CPM).

## **B. Reddit ads → Subreddits that convert**

* /r/selfhosted
* /r/linux
* /r/commandline
* /r/programming
* /r/Artificial

Use a GIF of the TUI instead of text → 3–5× better CTR.

## **C. Sponsoring Search Queries on Kagi**

You can buy “sponsor slots” for queries like:

* *ai t-ui*
* *cli ai agent*
* *terminal automation ai*

This is a little-known hack but powerful because Kagi users skew highly technical and influential.

---

# 🔥 **5. Extremely Novel Strategies (Nobody Does These But They Work)**

## **A. Build a “Mystery Quest” (ARG) in the repo**

Hide a cryptographic puzzle in your code or docs leading to a secret page.

This attracts hackers, security researchers, and curious devs.

## **B. Offer a 60-minute weekly “Office Hours” livestream**

Show new features, build plugins live.

This builds community fast.

## **C. Create a very short YouTube Short / TikTok**

Show a **10-sec hypnotic terminal animation**:

> “AI should feel like this again.”

You'll attract terminal nerds instantly.

## **D. Submit it to GitHub’s “Trending Weekly” manually**

Posting at the right time (Monday 9–10am PST) + coordinated social posting can help you hit the Trending charts.

---

# 🎯 Summary: The Most Impactful 5 Tactics

### **2. Create visually satisfying terminal GIF demos using vhs.**

### **3. Add Pomera to Awesome lists + curate a plugin ecosystem.**

### **4. Run a small “developer challenge” with a bounty.**
