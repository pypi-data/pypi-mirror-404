"""
"Arpeggio" is the codename of the 2nd revision of the Stringman gripper

It differs from the previous gripper in that it has a wrist instead of a winch.
Since it uses smart servos it can report the exact angle of either the fingers or wrist
It does not send 'line records' because there is no changing length of line, but wherever line
records were being used as a heartbeat signal, the grip sensors can be used instead.

It has a wide angle camera instead of standard, and the camera is pointed inward at a point 1m below the gripper

The gripper and gantry are now one model, with the gripper's origin being 57cm below the gantry's.
They are related by a chain of poses from the gantry tags, through the wrist rotation,
