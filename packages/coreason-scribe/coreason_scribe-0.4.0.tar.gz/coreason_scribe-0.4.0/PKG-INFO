## Executive Summary

`coreason-scribe` is the GxP documentation automation engine for the CoReason ecosystem. It addresses the "Validation Gap" where documentation inevitably drifts from code.

By treating **Documentation as Code**, `coreason-scribe` parses your agent's logic, uses AI to generate human-readable summaries (System Design Specifications), enforces Risk-Based Traceability (Requirements ↔ Tests), and facilitates a rigorous **"Draft-Review-Sign"** workflow. It ensures that no release is published without a cryptographically signed artifact proving it meets all requirements.

`coreason-scribe` can operate as a local CLI tool for developers or as a **Compliance Microservice** (FastAPI) integrated into CI/CD pipelines (e.g., `coreason-publisher`) and review platforms (`coreason-foundry`).

## Core Philosophy: "Code is Truth. AI Drafts. Humans Ratify. Diffs Reveal Risk."

1.  **AI as the Drafter:** Scans Python AST and generates plain-English business logic summaries.
2.  **Risk-Based Traceability:** Enforces 100% test coverage for High Risk features.
3.  **Semantic Delta:** Surfaces logical drift between versions, not just line-by-line diffs.
4.  **21 CFR Part 11 Signatures:** Requires cryptographic signatures for release certification.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Poetry

### Installation

```bash
poetry install
```

### Basic Usage

Generate a draft SDS from your source code:

```bash
poetry run python -m coreason_scribe.main draft \
  --source ./src \
  --output ./build \
  --version "0.1.0"
```

Run a compliance check (CI/CD Gate):

```bash
poetry run python -m coreason_scribe.main check \
  --agent-yaml ./agent.yaml \
  --assay-report ./assay_report.json
```

For detailed instructions, see the [Usage Guide](docs/usage.md).

### Server Mode (Microservice)

Start the REST API server:

```bash
poetry run uvicorn coreason_scribe.server:app --port 8001
# OR
docker run -p 8001:8001 coreason-scribe:latest
```
