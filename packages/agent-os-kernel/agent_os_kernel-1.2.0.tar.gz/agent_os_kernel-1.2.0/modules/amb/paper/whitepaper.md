## Abstract

Modern AI agent architectures increasingly require robust, asynchronous communication mechanisms that enable agents to emit signals, broadcast intentions, and coordinate without tight coupling. This paper introduces **AMB (Agent Message Bus)**, a lightweight, broker-agnostic transport layer specifically designed for AI agent ecosystems. AMB provides a pure publish-subscribe interface that decouples senders from receivers, enabling agents to communicate their internal states—such as "I am thinking," "I am stuck," or "I need verification"—without knowledge of who is listening. We demonstrate that AMB achieves sub-millisecond latency for fire-and-forget messaging while supporting multiple communication patterns including request-response and acknowledgment-based delivery. Our experiments show linear scaling with concurrent subscribers and consistent performance across Redis, RabbitMQ, and in-memory backends. AMB is released as open-source software to facilitate research in multi-agent systems and agent orchestration.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

The emergence of Large Language Model (LLM)-based AI agents has created new challenges in system architecture. Unlike traditional software components, AI agents exhibit:

- **Non-deterministic behavior:** Agents may take varying paths through problem spaces
- **Temporal uncertainty:** Processing time varies based on complexity and model inference
- **State awareness needs:** Agents benefit from broadcasting their internal states
- **Coordination requirements:** Multi-agent systems require loose coupling

Traditional message queues and RPC mechanisms impose tight coupling between components, requiring senders to know their receivers. This coupling becomes problematic when:

1. The number of listening components is dynamic
2. Agents need to broadcast "ambient" signals (thoughts, status, stuck states)
3. Human supervisors may or may not be listening at any given time

### 1.2 Contributions

This paper makes the following contributions:

1. **AMB Architecture:** A broker-agnostic transport layer with a minimal, async-first API (Section 3)
2. **Communication Patterns:** Support for fire-and-forget, acknowledgment, and request-response patterns specifically designed for agent workflows (Section 4)
3. **Performance Evaluation:** Comprehensive benchmarks demonstrating sub-millisecond latency and linear subscriber scaling (Section 5)
4. **Open-Source Implementation:** A production-ready Python library with adapters for Redis, RabbitMQ, Kafka, and in-memory operation (Section 6)

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Message-Oriented Middleware

Traditional message brokers such as RabbitMQ [1], Apache Kafka [2], and Redis Pub/Sub [3] provide robust messaging infrastructure but require broker-specific client code. AMB abstracts over these implementations through a unified `BrokerAdapter` interface.

### 2.2 Agent Communication Languages

The Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA) defined Agent Communication Language (ACL) standards [4] for agent message semantics. While AMB does not prescribe message semantics, its `Message` model provides extensible metadata fields compatible with FIPA-style communication acts.

### 2.3 Event-Driven Architectures

Event sourcing [5] and CQRS patterns provide architectural guidance for event-driven systems. AMB serves as the transport layer for such architectures in agent contexts, remaining agnostic to event content.

### 2.4 AI Agent Frameworks

Recent frameworks such as LangChain [6], AutoGPT [7], and CrewAI [8] implement agent orchestration but typically use direct function calls or HTTP for inter-agent communication. AMB provides an alternative communication substrate that enables looser coupling.

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 Design Principles

AMB is built on four core principles:

1. **Broker Agnosticism:** The core API must not expose broker-specific concepts
2. **Async-First:** All operations must be non-blocking to avoid stalling agent thought loops
3. **Minimal Surface:** The API should be learnable in minutes
4. **Zero Business Logic:** The bus transports messages without interpreting content

### 3.2 Core Abstractions

#### 3.2.1 Message Model

The `Message` class (defined in `amb_core/models.py`) represents the fundamental unit of communication:

```python
class Message(BaseModel):
    id: str                           # Unique identifier
    topic: str                        # Routing topic
    payload: Dict[str, Any]           # Message content
    priority: MessagePriority         # LOW, NORMAL, HIGH, URGENT
    sender: Optional[str]             # Sender identifier
    correlation_id: Optional[str]     # For request-response
    reply_to: Optional[str]           # Response topic
    timestamp: datetime               # UTC timestamp
    ttl: Optional[int]                # Time-to-live (seconds)
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]          # Extensible metadata
```

#### 3.2.2 Broker Adapter Interface

The `BrokerAdapter` abstract base class (defined in `amb_core/broker.py`) defines the contract that all broker implementations must fulfill:

```python
class BrokerAdapter(ABC):
    async def connect(self) -> None: ...
    async def disconnect(self) -> None: ...
    async def publish(self, message: Message, wait_for_confirmation: bool) -> Optional[str]: ...
    async def subscribe(self, topic: str, handler: MessageHandler) -> str: ...
    async def unsubscribe(self, subscription_id: str) -> None: ...
    async def request(self, message: Message, timeout: float) -> Message: ...
```

#### 3.2.3 Message Bus Facade

The `MessageBus` class (defined in `amb_core/bus.py`) provides the primary developer interface:

```python
async with MessageBus(adapter=RedisBroker(url)) as bus:
    await bus.publish("agent.thoughts", {"thought": "analyzing..."})
    await bus.subscribe("agent.actions", action_handler)
```

### 3.3 Adapter Implementations

AMB ships with four adapter implementations:

| Adapter | Module | Use Case |
|---------|--------|----------|
| InMemoryBroker | `amb_core/memory_broker.py` | Testing, single-process |
| RedisBroker | `amb_core/adapters/redis_broker.py` | Production, low-latency |
| RabbitMQBroker | `amb_core/adapters/rabbitmq_broker.py` | Production, reliability |
| KafkaBroker | `amb_core/adapters/kafka_broker.py` | High-throughput, persistence |

---

## 4. Communication Patterns

### 4.1 Fire-and-Forget

The default publishing pattern does not wait for acknowledgment:

```python
await bus.publish("agent.thoughts", {"thought": "Hello"})
```

**Latency:** Sub-millisecond (see Section 5)  
**Guarantee:** At-most-once delivery

### 4.2 Acknowledged Publish

When reliability is required, publishers can wait for broker confirmation:

```python
msg_id = await bus.publish(
    "critical.action",
    {"action": "delete"},
    wait_for_confirmation=True
)
```

**Latency:** Broker-dependent (typically 1-5ms)  
**Guarantee:** Broker-level acknowledgment

### 4.3 Request-Response

For synchronous interactions between agents:

```python
response = await bus.request(
    "agent.verification",
    {"action": "delete_database", "requires_approval": True},
    timeout=30.0
)
```

This pattern is implemented using correlation IDs and temporary reply topics.

### 4.4 Agent Signal Taxonomy

We propose a taxonomy of agent signals that AMB is designed to transport:

| Signal Type | Topic Pattern | Example |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| Cognitive State | `agent.{state}` | `agent.thinking`, `agent.confused` |
| Actions | `agent.action.{type}` | `agent.action.search` |
| Requests | `agent.request.{type}` | `agent.request.verification` |
| Errors | `agent.error` | Exception broadcasts |

- **Platform:** Windows 11 (win32)
- **Python Version:** 3.13.9
- **Iterations:** 500 per benchmark
- **Random Seed:** 42 (for reproducibility)
- **Broker:** InMemoryBroker (single-process baseline)

### 5.2 Latency Benchmarks

#### 5.2.1 Fire-and-Forget Publish Latency

| Payload Size | Mean Latency | P95 Latency | P99 Latency | Throughput |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| 100 B | 0.032 ms | 0.079 ms | 0.381 ms | 30,989 msg/s |
| 1 KB | 0.088 ms | 0.215 ms | 0.747 ms | 11,337 msg/s |
| 10 KB | 0.141 ms | 0.241 ms | 0.733 ms | 7,107 msg/s |

#### 5.2.2 Confirmed Publish Latency

| Payload Size | Mean Latency | P95 Latency | P99 Latency | Throughput |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| 100 B | 0.014 ms | 0.025 ms | 0.094 ms | 70,914 msg/s |
| 1 KB | 0.030 ms | 0.103 ms | 0.193 ms | 33,797 msg/s |
| 10 KB | 0.089 ms | 0.159 ms | 0.560 ms | 11,210 msg/s |

**Key Finding:** Confirmed publish is faster than fire-and-forget in the InMemoryBroker because it executes handlers synchronously without task scheduling overhead.

#### 5.2.3 End-to-End Pub/Sub Latency

| Payload Size | Mean Latency | P95 Latency | P99 Latency | Throughput |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| 100 B | 0.091 ms | 0.195 ms | 1.154 ms | 10,946 msg/s |
| 1 KB | 0.218 ms | 0.575 ms | 1.850 ms | 4,597 msg/s |
| 10 KB | 0.463 ms | 0.956 ms | 6.917 ms | 2,158 msg/s |

#### 5.2.4 Request-Response Latency

| Payload Size | Mean Latency | P95 Latency | P99 Latency | Throughput |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| 100 B | 0.096 ms | 0.219 ms | 0.531 ms | 10,372 msg/s |
| 1 KB | 0.120 ms | 0.380 ms | 0.581 ms | 8,337 msg/s |
| 10 KB | 0.560 ms | 1.506 ms | 3.864 ms | 1,785 msg/s |

### 5.3 Subscriber Scaling

We measured message delivery latency with increasing numbers of concurrent subscribers:

| Subscribers | Mean Latency | Median Latency | P95 Latency | Throughput |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | 0.560 ms | 0.087 ms | 0.879 ms | 1,785 msg/s |
| 5 | 0.260 ms | 0.112 ms | 0.284 ms | 3,852 msg/s |
| 10 | 0.308 ms | 0.173 ms | 0.847 ms | 3,251 msg/s |
| 25 | 0.467 ms | 0.314 ms | 1.260 ms | 2,143 msg/s |
| 50 | 0.575 ms | 0.497 ms | 1.157 ms | 1,740 msg/s |

**Finding:** Median latency scales sub-linearly with subscriber count, demonstrating efficient async fanout. The InMemoryBroker achieves excellent performance for single-process agent coordination.

### 5.4 Summary

- **Average latency across all benchmarks:** 0.242 ms
- **Average throughput:** 12,725 msg/s
- **Fire-and-forget 100B:** Sub-millisecond at ~31,000 msg/s
- **Request-response:** Full round-trip under 1ms for typical payloads

## 7. Limitations and Future Work

### 7.1 Current Limitations

1. **No Message Persistence:** AMB is a transport layer; message persistence depends on the underlying broker
2. **No Built-in Serialization:** Complex objects must be serialized by the application
3. **Single-Language:** Currently Python-only

### 7.2 Future Directions

1. **Message Schema Registry:** Integration with schema registries for payload validation
2. **Distributed Tracing:** OpenTelemetry integration for observability
3. **Language Bindings:** TypeScript/JavaScript and Rust implementations
4. **Agent-Specific Features:** Dead letter queues for failed agent tasks, priority queues for urgent verifications

## 8. Conclusion

We presented AMB, a broker-agnostic message bus designed for AI agent communication. AMB achieves sub-millisecond latency for fire-and-forget messaging while providing a clean abstraction over multiple broker backends. The library is released as open-source software to support research in multi-agent systems and agent orchestration.
