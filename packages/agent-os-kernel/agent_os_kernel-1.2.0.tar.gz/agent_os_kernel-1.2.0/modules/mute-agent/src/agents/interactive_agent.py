"""
InteractiveAgent - The "Steel Man" / SOTA Baseline

This represents the State-of-the-Art (SOTA) approach to building agents,
based on modern frameworks like LangGraph and AutoGen.

Key Capabilities (The "Steel Man" Features):
1. Reflection: If a tool fails, reads the error and retries (Max 3 attempts)
2. Human-in-the-Loop: Can pause and ask user for clarification
3. System State Access: Can query infrastructure state
4. Context Reasoning: Uses available information to infer intent

This is implemented as an alias/wrapper for BaselineAgent to clearly
document what we're comparing against in the benchmarks.

Why this matters:
We admit that this baseline CAN solve problems, but we argue it solves
them INEFFICIENTLY due to:
- High token costs from reflection loops
- Latency from clarification requests
- User interruption from Human-in-the-Loop

The Mute Agent wins on EFFICIENCY, not just correctness.

    InteractiveAgent - The "Steel Man" SOTA Baseline
    
    This is essentially the BaselineAgent with explicit documentation
    that it represents the State-of-the-Art approach (LangGraph, AutoGen style).
    
    Architecture:
    - Maintains context by querying system state
    - Uses reasoning to infer missing parameters
    - Reflects on failures and retries (up to 3 turns)
    - Can ask user for clarification (Human-in-the-Loop)
    
    This is the "fair fight" baseline - not a strawman, but a competent agent
    that represents current industry best practices.
    
    The Thesis:
    "Clarification is a bug, not a feature, in autonomous systems."
    
    In high-throughput production systems:
    - Clarification kills latency (waiting for human response)
    - Reflection kills efficiency (multiple LLM calls)
    - State queries kill simplicity (complex context management)
    
    The Mute Agent proves that graph constraints provide:
    - Zero clarification needed (deterministic from graph)
    - Zero reflection needed (fail fast on constraints)
    - Zero state queries needed (context encoded in graph)

        Execute a user request using reflection and interactive clarification.
        
        This is the "SOTA" approach that:
        1. Attempts execution with available context
        2. Reflects on failures (up to 3 turns)
        3. May ask user for clarification (Human-in-the-Loop)
        
        The cost of this approach:
        - Multiple LLM calls for reflection
        - Waiting for user response (latency)
        - High token usage from tool definitions
