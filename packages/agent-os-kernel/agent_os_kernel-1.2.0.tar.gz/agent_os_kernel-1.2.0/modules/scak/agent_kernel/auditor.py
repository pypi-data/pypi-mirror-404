"""
Auditor - Simplified reference implementation for soft failure detection.

This is a reference implementation showing the core concept of detecting
"soft failures" (laziness) where agents give up without trying hard enough.

The production implementation is in completeness_auditor.py, which includes
more sophisticated features like differential auditing and teacher model integration.
