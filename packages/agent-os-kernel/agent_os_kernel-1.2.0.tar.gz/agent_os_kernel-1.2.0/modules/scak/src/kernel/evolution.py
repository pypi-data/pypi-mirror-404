"""
Adaptive Reward Shaping - Online RLAIF for Agent Behavior Evolution.

This implements "Scale by Addition" in the behavioral space - we don't retrain models,
we shape their behavior dynamically via context injection and rubric adjustment.

Core Principle: Reward = Outcome Quality × Behavioral Nudge
Where Behavioral Nudge is derived from real-time feedback (RLAIF-lite).

Architecture:
1. RewardShaper - Main orchestrator for reward evolution
2. FeedbackAnalyzer - Extracts correction vectors from feedback
3. RubricOptimizer - Applies gradients to rubric weights
4. NudgeGenerator - Converts weight changes to natural language instructions

    - "Good balance" → Keep current weights
