"""
Lesson Rubric - Structured retention scoring for lesson lifecycle management.

This module implements the systematic evaluation of lessons to determine
if they are "Worth Keeping" and which tier they belong in.

The Rubric Formula:
Score = Severity (S) + Generality (G) + Frequency (F)

Where:
- S (Severity): 10-50 points - Did it crash the app or just look ugly?
- G (Generality): 5-30 points - Is this about "All SQL" or "This specific row"?
- F (Frequency): 10-20 points - Have we seen this before?

Tier Assignment:
- Score >= 75: Tier 1 (Kernel) - Always present, safety-critical
- Score >= 40: Tier 2 (Skill Cache) - Load when tool is used
- Score < 40: Tier 3 (Archive) - Retrieve only via search

The Philosophy:
Not all lessons are created equal. A lesson about "Never delete root"
should be Tier 1. A lesson about "Q3 report is in archived partition"
can be Tier 3. This rubric makes that distinction systematic and measurable.

class LessonRubric:
    """
    Evaluates lessons with a structured retention score (0-100).
    
    This implements the three-factor rubric:
    1. Severity (S): How bad was the failure?
    2. Generality (G): How broadly applicable is this lesson?
    3. Frequency (F): How often does this pattern occur?
    
    The rubric is deterministic and explainable - we can always trace
    why a lesson was assigned to a specific tier.
    
    Architecture:
    - evaluate(): Main entry point that combines all factors
    - _calculate_severity_score(): Failure impact assessment
    - _calculate_generality_score(): Lesson scope analysis
    - _calculate_frequency_score(): Pattern recurrence tracking
    - _assign_tier(): Maps score to tier (75/40 thresholds)
