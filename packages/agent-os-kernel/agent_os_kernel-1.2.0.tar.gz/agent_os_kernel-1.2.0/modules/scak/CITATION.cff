abstract: "A production-ready self-correcting agent kernel implementing dual-loop architecture (runtime safety + alignment engine) with differential auditing, semantic purge, and three-tier memory hierarchy. Novel contributions include Type A/B patch decay taxonomy, 5-10% audit overhead via give-up signal detection, and 40-60% context reduction on model upgrades."
