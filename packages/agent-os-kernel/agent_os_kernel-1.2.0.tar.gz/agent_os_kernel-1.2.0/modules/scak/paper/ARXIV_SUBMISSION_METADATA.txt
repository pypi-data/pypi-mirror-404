ABSTRACT (required - max 1920 characters)
================================================================================
Production AI agents face a "Reliability Wall" defined by two invisible pathologies: laziness (premature give-ups on achievable tasks) and context rot (performance degradation due to accumulated prompt instructions). Existing architectures often exacerbate these issues by treating "more context" as the solution to every failure, leading to the Accumulation Paradox. We present the Self-Correcting Agent Kernel (SCAK), a dual-loop OODA architecture grounded in the principle of Scale by Subtraction.

SCAK's Runtime Loop ensures deterministic safety, while the Alignment Loop implements Differential Auditing: a probabilistic mechanism that compares a weak agent (GPT-4o) against a stronger teacher (o1-preview) only on "give-up signals" (5-10% of interactions). This catches capability failures that explicit error handlers miss. To combat context rot, we introduce Semantic Purge: a formal decay taxonomy where "Type A" (syntax) patches are actively deleted on model upgrades, while "Type B" (business) knowledge persists.

Evaluations on GAIA benchmark extensions demonstrate 100% laziness detection and a 72% correction rate (p<0.001) at 90% lower cost than full verification. Chaos engineering tests show <30s Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR), validating that reliability stems not from infinite memory, but from hygienic forgetting.
