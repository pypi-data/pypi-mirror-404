## 🚀 Highlights

- **28.1% improvement** in Precision@5 over flat-chunk baselines
- **0.003ms routing latency** — 150,000× faster than LLM-based routing
- **Five novel components**: Structure-Aware Indexing, Context Triad, Pragmatic Truth, Heuristic Router, Trust Gateway
- **Enterprise-ready**: Docker support, comprehensive tests, security features

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install context-as-a-service
```

Or with Docker:
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/imran-siddique/context-as-a-service:latest

## 🔧 Key Features

### Structure-Aware Indexing
Three-tier value hierarchy (High/Medium/Low) based on document structure.

### Context Triad
Hot/Warm/Cold prioritization with configurable token budgets:
- Hot: 2,000 tokens (current conversation)
- Warm: 1,000 tokens (user context)
- Cold: 5,000 tokens (retrieved knowledge)

### Pragmatic Truth
Surfaces practical knowledge from informal sources alongside official documentation.

### Heuristic Router
Deterministic, zero-latency query routing without ML inference.

### Trust Gateway
Enterprise security layer with input validation, audit logging, and rate limiting.
