"""
Heuristic Router: Speed > Smarts

The Naive Approach:
"Let's use a small LLM (like GPT-3.5) to classify the user's intent, and then route it to the right model."

The Engineering Reality:
This is "Model-on-Model" overhead. Even a small LLM takes 500ms+ to think. 
You are adding latency just to decide where to send the traffic. 
We need to be Fast, even if we are occasionally Wrong.

My Philosophy:
Use Deterministic Heuristics, not AI Classifiers. 
We can solve 80% of routing with simple logic that takes 0ms:

Rule 1: Is the query length < 50 characters? -> Send to Fast Model (GPT-4o-mini).
Rule 2: Does it contain keywords like "Summary", "Analyze", "Compare"? -> Send to Smart Model (GPT-4o).
Rule 3: Is it a greeting ("Hi", "Thanks")? -> Send to Canned Response (Zero Cost).

The goal isn't 100% routing accuracy. 
The goal is instant response time for the trivial stuff, 
preserving the "Big Brain" budget for the hard stuff.

    """
    Heuristic router using deterministic rules for instant routing decisions.
    
    This router uses simple pattern matching and heuristics to route queries
    without the overhead of calling an LLM classifier. The goal is speed over
    perfect accuracy - we accept occasional wrong classifications to achieve
    near-zero latency routing decisions.
    
    Philosophy: Fast even if occasionally wrong > Slow but always right
