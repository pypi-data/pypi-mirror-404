# Release v0.1.0 - Initial Public Release

**EMK (Episodic Memory Kernel)** - An immutable, append-only ledger of agent experiences for AI systems.

## 🎯 Highlights

- **Immutable Storage**: Episodes follow the Goal → Action → Result → Reflection pattern
- **Pluggable Backends**: FileAdapter (JSONL) and ChromaDBAdapter (vector search)
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Core requires only `pydantic` and `numpy`
- **Research Ready**: Reproducible benchmarks, paper structure, HF Hub integration

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install emk

# With vector search support
pip install emk[chromadb]

# With Hugging Face Hub integration
pip install emk[huggingface]

# Everything
pip install emk[all]
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from emk import Episode, FileAdapter

store = FileAdapter("memories.jsonl")

episode = Episode(
    goal="Retrieve user data",
    action="Query database",
    result="Success",
    reflection="Efficient query"
)

episode_id = store.store(episode)
```

## 📊 Performance (1000 episodes, seed=42)

| Operation | Latency | Throughput |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| Episode Creation | 0.036ms | 27,694 ops/sec |
| Storage Write | 1.53ms | 652 ops/sec |
| Retrieval | 25.8ms | 39 ops/sec |
| Indexer | 0.088ms | 11,346 ops/sec |
