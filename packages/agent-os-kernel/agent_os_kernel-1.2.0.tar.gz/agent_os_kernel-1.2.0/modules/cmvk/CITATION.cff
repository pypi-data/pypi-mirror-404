abstract: >-
  CMVK is an adversarial multi-model verification framework that addresses
  the "grading your own homework" fallacy in AI systems. By employing
  strategic model diversity with separate Generator and Verifier roles,
  CMVK reduces correlated blind spots and detects hallucinations that
  self-verification would miss.
