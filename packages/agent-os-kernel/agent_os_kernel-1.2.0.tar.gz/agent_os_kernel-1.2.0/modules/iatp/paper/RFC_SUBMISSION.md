# RFC Submission Guide for IATP

This document outlines the strategy for submitting the IATP protocol to standards bodies.

## Target Organizations

### 1. W3C Community Group (Primary Target)

**Why W3C:**
- Open community process
- Proven track record with web standards
- Relevant groups: Web of Things, Credentials, DID

**Steps:**
1. Create a Community Group: "Agent Interoperability CG"
2. Submit the capability manifest schema
3. Host discussions on protocol evolution
4. Build community consensus

**Timeline:** Q1 2026

**Required Materials:**
- Capability manifest JSON schema ✅ (in `/spec/schema/`)
- Protocol specification ✅ (in `/spec/`)
- Reference implementation ✅ (Python SDK + Go sidecar)
- Test suite ✅ (32 tests)

### 2. IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)

**Why IETF:**
- Internet protocol standards body
- Home to TCP/IP, HTTP, TLS
- Relevant working groups: HTTP, OAuth, Security Area

**Steps:**
1. Submit Internet-Draft (I-D) for IATP protocol
2. Present at IETF meeting
3. Form working group if there's interest
4. Iterate towards RFC status

**Timeline:** Q2-Q3 2026

**Required Materials:**
- Internet-Draft in RFC format
- Implementation report
- Security considerations document
- Interoperability testing results

### 3. OpenAPI Initiative

**Why OpenAPI:**
- API specification standards
- Wide industry adoption
- Could extend OpenAPI spec with IATP metadata

**Steps:**
1. Propose extension to OpenAPI 3.1+
2. Add `x-iatp-capability-manifest` field
3. Submit to Technical Steering Committee

**Timeline:** Q2 2026

### 4. Linux Foundation / CNCF

**Why CNCF:**
- Cloud-native infrastructure focus
- Home to Envoy, Istio, gRPC
- Could position IATP as "Envoy for Agents"

**Steps:**
1. Submit project to CNCF Sandbox
2. Build community and adoption
3. Graduate to Incubating/Graduated

**Timeline:** Q3-Q4 2026

### Key Sections

#### 1. Introduction

```
The Inter-Agent Trust Protocol (IATP) provides a standardized
mechanism for AI agents to discover capabilities, negotiate trust,
and enforce security policies when collaborating with other agents.

IATP addresses the "zero-trust void" in current agent-to-agent
communication by introducing:
- Capability manifests for discovery
- Trust score calculation for risk assessment
- Policy enforcement for security
- Flight recorder for audit trails
```

#### 2. Capability Manifest Format

```
A capability manifest is a JSON document that describes an agent's
capabilities, trust level, reversibility guarantees, and privacy
policies.

The manifest MUST include:
- identity: Agent identification
- trust_level: One of [verified_partner, trusted, standard, unknown, untrusted]
- capabilities: Operational capabilities (idempotency, concurrency, SLA)
- reversibility: Undo/compensation capabilities
- privacy: Data retention and usage policies

See Appendix B for complete JSON Schema.
```

#### 3. Trust Score Calculation

```
Trust scores are calculated on a scale of 0-10 based on:
- Base score from trust_level
- Adjustments for reversibility (+2 if not "none")
- Adjustments for retention policy (+1 ephemeral, -1 permanent)
- Penalties for human_in_loop (-2) and training_consent (-1)

The algorithm is deterministic and MUST be implemented consistently
across all IATP implementations.
```

#### 4. Security Considerations

```
This section discusses:
- Manifest authenticity and verification
- Trust score gaming and mitigation
- Privacy implications of manifest disclosure
- Replay attacks and prevention
- Side-channel attacks through timing
```

## Namespace Registration

### JSON Schema Registry

Register the capability manifest schema:
- **Schema ID**: `https://inter-agent-trust.org/v1/capability-manifest.json`
- **Namespace**: `https://inter-agent-trust.org/v1/`
- **Version**: 1.0.0

### MIME Type Registration

Register IATP-specific MIME types:
- `application/vnd.iatp.capability-manifest+json`
- `application/vnd.iatp.trace-log+json`

### HTTP Headers

Register IATP-specific HTTP headers:
- `X-Agent-Trace-ID`: Distributed tracing identifier
- `X-User-Override`: User consent for risky operations
- `X-IATP-Trust-Score`: Calculated trust score
