## Design Principles Grounded in Research

### 1. Deterministic Enforcement Over Probabilistic Filtering

**Research Basis:**
- "A Safety Framework for Real-World Agentic Systems" emphasizes that safety mechanisms must be deterministic and not rely on LLM reasoning
- Operating systems use permission-based security (not request-based) for a reason

**Implementation:**
- Agent Kernel enforces permissions at the API boundary
- Policy evaluation occurs before execution, not during
- No reliance on prompt engineering for security

### 2. Layered Defense Architecture

**Research Basis:**
- "MAESTRO: A Threat Modeling Framework" recommends defense-in-depth for agentic systems
- Multiple validation layers reduce single-point-of-failure risks

**Implementation:**
- Layer 1: Permission checking (Agent Kernel)
- Layer 2: Policy evaluation (Policy Engine)
- Layer 3: Resource constraints (Execution Engine)
- Layer 4: Runtime monitoring (Supervisor Agents)

### 3. Capability-Based Security (The Mute Agent)

**Research Basis:**
- Principle of least privilege from security research
- "If a system can't do something, it can't be tricked into doing it"

**Implementation:**
- Agents receive only necessary permissions
- Out-of-scope requests return NULL, not refusals
- No "helpful" hallucinations that might bypass boundaries

### 4. Simulation Before Execution (Shadow Mode)

**Research Basis:**
- "Practices for Governing Agentic AI Systems" recommends simulation for pre-deployment testing
- Reduces risk of unintended consequences in production

**Implementation:**
- Actions intercepted before execution
- Full policy validation without side effects
- Statistical analysis of agent behavior patterns

### 5. Multi-Dimensional Context (Constraint Graphs)

**Research Basis:**
- Context-aware access control from ABAC research
- "Privacy in Agentic Systems" emphasizes context in data governance

**Implementation:**
- Data Graph: What exists (data resources)
- Policy Graph: What's allowed (business rules)
- Temporal Graph: What's true now (time-based constraints)

## Benchmark Methodology

Our comparative safety study follows research-backed evaluation practices:

### Dataset Design
Based on "Red-Teaming Agentic AI" taxonomy:
- Direct violations (15 prompts): SQL injection, system commands
- Prompt injections (15 prompts): Jailbreaks, instruction overrides
- Contextual confusion (15 prompts): Social engineering
- Valid requests (15 prompts): False positive testing

### Metrics
Following "Evaluating Agentic AI" frameworks:
- **Safety Violation Rate (SVR)**: % of malicious prompts that succeed
- **False Positive Rate (FPR)**: % of valid requests incorrectly blocked
- **Token Efficiency**: Output tokens used (lower is better for "scale by subtraction")
- **Response Time**: Mean time to decision (µs)

### Baseline Comparison
- **Prompt-based safety**: Industry standard (system prompts with safety instructions)
- **Control Plane governance**: Our deterministic approach

## Open Research Questions

Areas where further research is needed:

1. **Optimal Supervision Ratios**: What's the right supervisor-to-worker agent ratio?
2. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: How to handle emergent behaviors in agent swarms?
3. **Privacy-Utility Tradeoffs**: Balancing governance with agent capabilities
4. **Adversarial Robustness**: Can deterministic systems handle all attack vectors?
5. **Human-in-the-Loop**: When should humans intervene in agent decisions?
