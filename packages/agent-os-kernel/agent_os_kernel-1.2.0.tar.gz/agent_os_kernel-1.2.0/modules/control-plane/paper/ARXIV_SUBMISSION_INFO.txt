================================================================================
Modern AI agents capable of executing real-world actions---querying databases, calling APIs, writing files---face a critical reliability gap: their stochastic nature makes safety guarantees elusive, and prompt-based guardrails fail under adversarial conditions. We introduce the Agent Control Plane (ACP), a kernel-inspired middleware layer that enforces deterministic governance through attribute-based access control (ABAC), multi-dimensional constraint graphs, and shadow mode simulation.

Unlike advisory systems that merely suggest safe behavior, ACP interposes between agent intent and action execution, achieving 0.00% safety violations on a 60-prompt red-team benchmark spanning direct attacks, prompt injections, and contextual confusion---with zero false positives. Our key insight, Scale by Subtraction, replaces verbose LLM-generated refusals with deterministic NULL responses, yielding a 98.1% token reduction while eliminating information leakage about blocked actions.

Ablation studies with statistical rigor (Welch's t-test, Bonferroni correction) confirm component necessity: removing the PolicyEngine increases violations from 0% to 40.0% (p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 8.7). We demonstrate production readiness through integrations with OpenAI function calling, LangChain agents, and multi-agent orchestration.
