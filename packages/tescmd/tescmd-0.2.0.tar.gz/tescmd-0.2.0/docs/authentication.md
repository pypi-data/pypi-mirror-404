# Authentication

tescmd uses Tesla's OAuth2 flow with PKCE for user authentication, and EC key pairs for vehicle command authorization. This document covers the full lifecycle.

## Overview

There are two separate auth concerns:

1. **OAuth2 tokens** — identify the user to Tesla's Fleet API (required for all API calls, both commands and data queries)
2. **EC key pairs** — authorize signed commands to the vehicle (required for vehicle commands; not needed for read-only data queries)

Most users only need OAuth2. Key enrollment is required for command signing on newer vehicles using the vehicle command protocol.

## OAuth2 PKCE Flow

### Prerequisites

You need a Tesla Developer account and a registered application:

1. Go to [developer.tesla.com](https://developer.tesla.com)
2. Create an application
3. Note your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
4. Set the redirect URI to `http://localhost:8085/callback` (tescmd's default)

### Login

```bash
tescmd auth login
```

This runs an interactive OAuth2 PKCE flow:

```
Step 1: tescmd generates a PKCE code_verifier (random 128-byte string)
        and derives a code_challenge (SHA-256 hash, base64url-encoded)

Step 2: tescmd starts a local HTTP server on localhost:8085

Step 3: tescmd opens the system browser to Tesla's authorization endpoint:
        https://auth.tesla.com/oauth2/v3/authorize
        ?client_id=<CLIENT_ID>
        &redirect_uri=http://localhost:8085/callback
        &response_type=code
        &scope=openid vehicle_device_data vehicle_cmds vehicle_charging_cmds energy_device_data energy_cmds user_data offline_access
        &code_challenge=<CHALLENGE>
        &code_challenge_method=S256
        &state=<RANDOM>

Step 4: User logs in to Tesla account in the browser
        and grants permissions to the application

Step 5: Tesla redirects to http://localhost:8085/callback?code=<AUTH_CODE>&state=<STATE>
        tescmd's local server captures the authorization code

Step 6: tescmd exchanges the code for tokens:
        POST https://auth.tesla.com/oauth2/v3/token
        {
          "grant_type": "authorization_code",
          "client_id": "<CLIENT_ID>",
          "client_secret": "<CLIENT_SECRET>",
          "code": "<AUTH_CODE>",
          "code_verifier": "<VERIFIER>",
          "redirect_uri": "http://localhost:8085/callback"
        }

Step 7: Tesla returns access_token, refresh_token, expires_in, id_token

Step 8: tescmd stores tokens in the OS keyring
```

### Scopes

tescmd requests these OAuth2 scopes:

| Scope | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `openid` | User identity |
| `vehicle_device_data` | Read vehicle state (location, battery, climate, etc.) |
| `vehicle_cmds` | Send commands (lock, unlock, climate, etc.) |
| `vehicle_charging_cmds` | Charging commands (start, stop, schedule) |
| `energy_device_data` | Energy product data (Powerwall, Solar) |
| `energy_cmds` | Energy product commands (backup reserve, operation mode) |
| `user_data` | User account info (profile, orders, features) |
| `offline_access` | Refresh token for long-lived sessions |

### Token Management

**Storage:** Tokens are stored in the OS keyring via the `keyring` library:
- macOS: Keychain
- Linux: GNOME Keyring / KWallet / SecretService
- Windows: Windows Credential Locker

**Refresh:** Access tokens expire (typically 8 hours). tescmd automatically refreshes using the refresh token when a 401 response is received. The refresh is transparent — the original request is retried with the new token.

**Manual refresh:**
```bash
tescmd auth refresh
```

**Check status:**
```bash
tescmd auth status
```

Displays: token expiry time, scopes, associated region, and whether refresh token is available.

**Re-consent for new scopes:**
```bash
tescmd auth login --reconsent
```

If your application adds new scopes after initial login, Tesla caches the original consent and won't prompt for the new ones. The `--reconsent` flag sends `prompt_missing_scopes=true` to Tesla's authorize endpoint, which forces the consent screen to show any scopes not yet granted.

After login, tescmd decodes the JWT access token and warns if any requested scopes are missing from the granted set:

```
Warning: token is missing scopes: energy_cmds, user_data
  Run: tescmd auth login --reconsent
```

**Logout:**
```bash
tescmd auth logout
```

Removes tokens from the keyring. Does not revoke the tokens server-side (Tesla's API does not support token revocation).

## Token Storage Details

```
Keyring entries (per profile):
  service: tescmd
  username: <profile_name>/access_token
  password: <access_token_value>

  service: tescmd
  username: <profile_name>/refresh_token
  password: <refresh_token_value>

  service: tescmd
  username: <profile_name>/token_meta
  password: <json: {expires_at, scopes, region}>
```

## EC Key Pairs

### Why Keys?

Tesla's newer vehicle command protocol requires commands to be signed with an EC key that has been registered (enrolled) on the vehicle. This is separate from OAuth2 — the OAuth token identifies the user, while the EC signature proves the command came from a trusted device.

**Read-only operations** (vehicle data, location, battery status) do **not** require key enrollment — they only need a valid OAuth token.

### Key Generation

```bash
tescmd key generate
```

Generates a P-256 (secp256r1) EC key pair and stores it:
- Private key: `~/.config/tescmd/keys/private_key.pem`
- Public key: `~/.config/tescmd/keys/public_key.pem`

### Key Deployment

Before enrollment, the public key must be deployed to your domain so Tesla can verify it:

```bash
tescmd key deploy
```

This deploys the public key to your GitHub Pages site at the `.well-known/appspecific/com.tesla.3p.public-key.pem` path that Tesla requires.

Verify it's accessible:

```bash
tescmd key validate
```

### Key Enrollment

Once deployed, enroll the key on a vehicle:

```bash
tescmd key enroll 5YJ3E1EA1NF000000
```

This opens the Tesla enrollment URL on your phone. Tap "Finish Setup" on the web page, then approve the "Add Virtual Key" prompt in the Tesla app. You can verify the key under Profile > Security & Privacy > Third-Party Apps.

See [vehicle-command-protocol.md](vehicle-command-protocol.md) for protocol details.

### Key Usage

Once enrolled, tescmd automatically signs vehicle commands with the private key. This is transparent — the `SignedCommandAPI` layer handles session management and signing.

```
Command flow with signing:

  1. SignedCommandAPI looks up command in protocol registry
  2. SessionManager establishes ECDH session (or uses cached session)
  3. Command payload is signed with HMAC-SHA256
  4. Signed RoutableMessage sent to /signed_command endpoint
  5. Vehicle verifies signature against enrolled public key
  6. Command executes
```

The `command_protocol` setting controls whether signing is used:
- `auto` (default) — sign when keys are available, fall back to unsigned
- `signed` — require signing (error if no keys)
- `unsigned` — force legacy REST path

## Headless Authentication

For servers and bots that can't open a browser, use environment-based auth:

### Option 1: Pre-obtained Tokens

Obtain tokens on a machine with a browser, then transfer:

```bash
# On machine with browser
tescmd auth login
tescmd auth export > tokens.json  # exports tokens as JSON

# On headless machine
tescmd auth import < tokens.json
```

### Option 2: Direct Environment Variables

If you manage tokens externally:

```dotenv
TESLA_ACCESS_TOKEN=eyJ...
TESLA_REFRESH_TOKEN=eyJ...
```

When `TESLA_ACCESS_TOKEN` is set, tescmd uses it directly without checking the keyring.

## Multi-Profile Authentication

Each profile has its own token set:

```bash
# Login to default profile
tescmd auth login

# Login to a different profile
tescmd --profile work-car auth login

# Check status of a specific profile
tescmd --profile work-car auth status
```

Profiles are independent — different Tesla accounts, different regions, different vehicles.

## Security Considerations

- **Tokens in keyring** — never stored in plaintext config files
- **Client secret in `.env`** — gitignored, not in config.toml
- **Private keys file-permission protected** — `chmod 600` on generation
- **PKCE** — prevents authorization code interception
- **State parameter** — prevents CSRF in OAuth flow
- **Local callback server** — binds to localhost only, ephemeral port option available
