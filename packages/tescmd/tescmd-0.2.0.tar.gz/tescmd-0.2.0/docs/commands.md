# Command Reference

Reference for all currently implemented tescmd commands. Commands fall into two categories:

- **Queries** — read vehicle state (location, battery, temperature, etc.). Require OAuth token only.
- **Actions** — send commands to the vehicle (charge, climate, security, trunk, media, nav, software, wake, key enrollment). Require OAuth token and may require enrolled EC key for signed commands.

## Global Options

These options apply to all commands:

```
--vin VIN           Vehicle Identification Number (overrides profile default)
--profile NAME      Use named config profile (default: "default")
--format FORMAT     Output format: rich, json, quiet (default: auto-detect)
--quiet             Shorthand for --format quiet
--region REGION     API region: na, eu, cn (default: from profile or "na")
--verbose           Enable debug logging to stderr
--help              Show help for any command or subcommand
```

## VIN Resolution

Many commands require a vehicle VIN. tescmd resolves it in order:

1. Positional argument: `tescmd vehicle info 5YJ3E1EA1NF000000`
2. `--vin` flag: `tescmd vehicle info --vin 5YJ3E1EA1NF000000`
3. `TESLA_VIN` environment variable
4. Profile default: `vin` field in active config profile
5. Interactive picker: lists your vehicles and prompts you to choose

## `setup` — First-Run Configuration

Interactive, tiered onboarding wizard that walks you through everything needed to start using tescmd. Running `tescmd setup` handles the entire bootstrapping process from zero to working CLI — domain provisioning, Tesla Developer Portal credentials, key generation, Fleet API registration, and OAuth login — with clear guidance and automatic error remediation at each step.

```bash
tescmd setup
```

### Tier Selection (Phase 0)

The wizard starts by asking how you want to use tescmd:

1. **Read-only** — view vehicle data, location, battery status. Requires a Tesla Developer app and a registered domain.
2. **Full control** — everything in read-only, plus lock/unlock, charge, climate, etc. Additionally requires an EC key pair deployed to your domain.

If you've previously run setup, the wizard remembers your tier and offers to upgrade from read-only to full control.

### Domain Setup (Phase 1)

Tesla requires a registered domain for Fleet API access. The wizard offers two paths:

- **Automated (recommended):** If the GitHub CLI (`gh`) is installed and authenticated, the wizard auto-creates a `<username>.github.io` GitHub Pages site and configures it as your domain. No manual steps needed.
- **Manual:** Enter your own domain. You'll need to host the `.well-known/appspecific/com.tesla.3p.public-key.pem` file yourself.

The domain is persisted to `~/.config/tescmd/.env` as `TESLA_DOMAIN`.

### Developer Portal Setup (Phase 2)

If credentials aren't already configured, the wizard walks you through:

1. Creating a Tesla Developer account at [developer.tesla.com](https://developer.tesla.com)
2. Creating an application with the correct redirect URI (`http://localhost:8085/callback`)
3. Setting the **Allowed Origin URL** to match your domain from Phase 1
4. Entering your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

Credentials are stored in `~/.config/tescmd/.env` as `TESLA_CLIENT_ID` and `TESLA_CLIENT_SECRET`.

### Key Generation & Deployment (Phase 3 — full tier only)

For full-control access, the wizard:

1. Generates an EC P-256 key pair (stored in `~/.config/tescmd/keys/`)
2. Deploys the public key to your GitHub Pages domain at the Tesla-required `.well-known` path
3. Waits for GitHub Pages to publish and verifies the key is accessible

If the key is already generated or deployed, these steps are skipped.

### Fleet API Registration (Phase 4)

Registers your application with Tesla's Fleet API for your region. This is a one-time requirement. The wizard:

1. Pre-checks that your public key is accessible (required by Tesla)
2. If the key isn't live, offers to generate and deploy it automatically
3. Calls the partner registration endpoint
4. On failure, provides specific remediation steps:
   - **HTTP 412 (origin mismatch):** Instructions to fix the Allowed Origin URL in the Developer Portal
   - **HTTP 424 (key not found):** Steps to generate, deploy, and validate the public key

### OAuth Login (Phase 5)

Opens your browser for Tesla OAuth2 authentication using PKCE. The wizard:

1. Starts a local callback server on port 8085
2. Opens the Tesla authorization page
3. Waits for you to sign in and grant permissions
4. Stores tokens securely in the OS keyring

If you're already logged in, this step is skipped.

### Next Steps (Phase 6)

After setup completes, the wizard prints suggested commands to try:

```
tescmd vehicle list      — list your vehicles
tescmd vehicle data      — view detailed vehicle data
tescmd vehicle location  — view vehicle location
```

For full-tier users, it also reminds you to approve the key enrollment in the Tesla app (Profile > Security & Privacy > Third-Party Apps).

### Re-running Setup

`tescmd setup` is safe to re-run. Each phase checks for existing configuration and skips completed steps. You can re-run it to:

- Upgrade from read-only to full control
- Re-register after changing your domain
- Complete steps that failed on a previous run

---

## `auth` — Authentication

Manage OAuth2 authentication lifecycle.

### `auth login`

Start the OAuth2 PKCE flow. Opens a browser for Tesla login.

```bash
tescmd auth login
tescmd auth login --port 9090       # custom callback port
tescmd auth login --reconsent       # force re-consent for expanded scopes
```

The `--reconsent` flag is needed when your application adds new OAuth scopes after initial login. Tesla caches the original consent, so without this flag, new scopes won't be granted.

### `auth logout`

Remove stored tokens from the keyring.

```bash
tescmd auth logout
tescmd auth logout --profile work   # logout specific profile
```

### `auth status`

Display current authentication state.

```bash
tescmd auth status
```

Output includes: token expiry, scopes, region, refresh token availability.

### `auth refresh`

Manually refresh the access token.

```bash
tescmd auth refresh
```

### `auth register`

Register your application with the Tesla Fleet API for a given region. This is a one-time step after creating your developer application.

```bash
tescmd auth register
```

### `auth export`

Export current tokens as JSON for transfer to another machine.

```bash
tescmd auth export > tokens.json
```

### `auth import`

Import tokens from a previously exported JSON file.

```bash
tescmd auth import < tokens.json
```
