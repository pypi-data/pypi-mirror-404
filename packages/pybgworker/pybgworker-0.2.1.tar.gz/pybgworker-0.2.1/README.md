# PyBgWorker

A lightweight, production-ready background task framework for Python.

PyBgWorker provides a durable SQLite-backed task queue, cron scheduling,
rate limiting, retries, and structured observability — all without external
infrastructure.

It is designed to be simple, reliable, and easy to deploy.

## ✨ Features

- Persistent SQLite task queue
- Multi-worker safe execution
- Retry + failure handling
- Crash isolation via subprocess
- Cron scheduler for recurring jobs
- JSON structured logging
- Task duration tracking
- Rate limiting (overload protection)
- Heartbeat monitoring
- CLI inspect / retry / purge / cancel
- Production-safe worker loop

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
pip install pybgworker
```

---

## 🧠 Basic Usage

### Define a task

```python
from pybgworker.task import task

@task(name="add")
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

### Enqueue a task

```python
add.delay(1, 2)
```

---

## ▶ Run worker

```bash
python -m pybgworker.cli run --app example
```

---

## ⏰ Cron Scheduler

Run recurring tasks:

```python
from pybgworker.scheduler import cron
from pybgworker.task import task

@task(name="heartbeat_task")
@cron("*/1 * * * *")
def heartbeat():
    print("alive")
```

Cron runs automatically inside the worker.

---

## 📊 JSON Logging

All worker events are structured JSON:

```json
{"event":"task_start","task_id":"..."}
{"event":"task_success","duration":0.12}
```

This enables:

- monitoring
- analytics
- alerting
- observability pipelines

---

## 🚦 Rate Limiting

Protect infrastructure from overload:

```python
RATE_LIMIT = 5  # tasks per second
```

Ensures predictable execution under heavy load.

---

## 🔍 CLI Commands

Inspect queue:

```bash
python -m pybgworker.cli inspect
```

Retry failed task:

```bash
python -m pybgworker.cli retry <task_id>
```

Cancel task:

```bash
python -m pybgworker.cli cancel <task_id>
```

Purge queued tasks:

```bash
python -m pybgworker.cli purge
```

---

## 🧪 Observability

PyBgWorker logs:

- worker start
- cron events
- task start
- success
- retry
- failure
- timeout
- crash
- heartbeat errors

All machine-readable.

## 🎯 Design Goals

- zero external dependencies
- SQLite durability
- safe multiprocessing
- operator-friendly CLI
- production observability
- infrastructure protection

## 📌 Roadmap

Future upgrades may include:

- dashboard web UI
- metrics endpoint
- Redis backend
- workflow pipelines
- cluster coordination
