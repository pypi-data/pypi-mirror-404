# cribl_control_plane_sdk_python

The Cribl Python SDK for the control plane provides operational control over Cribl resources and helps streamline the process of integrating with Cribl.

In addition to the usage examples in this repository, the Cribl documentation includes [code examples for common use cases](https://docs.cribl.io/cribl-as-code/code-examples).

Complementary API reference documentation is available at https://docs.cribl.io/cribl-as-code/api-reference. Product documentation is available at https://docs.cribl.io.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Preview Feature**
> The Cribl SDKs are Preview features that are still being developed. We do not recommend using them in a production environment, because the features might not be fully tested or optimized for performance, and related documentation could be incomplete.
>
> Please continue to submit feedback through normal Cribl support channels, but assistance might be limited while the features remain in Preview.

<!-- Start SDK Installation [installation] -->
## SDK Installation

> [!NOTE]
> **Python version upgrade policy**
>
> Once a Python version reaches its [official end of life date](https://devguide.python.org/versions/), a 3-month grace period is provided for users to upgrade. Following this grace period, the minimum python version supported in the SDK will be updated.

The SDK can be installed with *uv*, *pip*, or *poetry* package managers.

### uv

*uv* is a fast Python package installer and resolver, designed as a drop-in replacement for pip and pip-tools. It's recommended for its speed and modern Python tooling capabilities.

```bash
uv add cribl-control-plane
```

### PIP

*PIP* is the default package installer for Python, enabling easy installation and management of packages from PyPI via the command line.

```bash
pip install cribl-control-plane
```

### Poetry

*Poetry* is a modern tool that simplifies dependency management and package publishing by using a single `pyproject.toml` file to handle project metadata and dependencies.

```bash
poetry add cribl-control-plane
```

### Shell and script usage with `uv`

You can use this SDK in a Python shell with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and the `uvx` command that comes with it like so:

```shell
uvx --from cribl-control-plane python
```

It's also possible to write a standalone Python script without needing to set up a whole project like so:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.9"
# dependencies = [
#     "cribl-control-plane",
# ]
# ///

from cribl_control_plane import CriblControlPlane

sdk = CriblControlPlane(
  # SDK arguments
)

# Rest of script here...
```

Once that is saved to a file, you can run it with `uv run script.py` where
`script.py` can be replaced with the actual file name.

<!-- Start IDE Support [idesupport] -->
## IDE Support

### PyCharm

Generally, the SDK will work well with most IDEs out of the box. However, when using PyCharm, you can enjoy much better integration with Pydantic by installing an additional plugin.

## SDK Example Usage

### Example

```python
# Synchronous Example
from cribl_control_plane import CriblControlPlane, models
import os

with CriblControlPlane(
    server_url="https://api.example.com",
    security=models.Security(
        bearer_auth=os.getenv("CRIBLCONTROLPLANE_BEARER_AUTH", ""),
    ),
) as ccp_client:
    # Check server health
    health = ccp_client.health.get()
    print(f"Server health: {health}")

    worker_group_id = "my-worker-group"
    group_url = f"https://api.example.com/m/{worker_group_id}"

    # List all sources
    sources = ccp_client.sources.list(server_url=group_url)
    print(f"Found {len(sources.items or [])} sources")

    # List all destinations
    destinations = ccp_client.destinations.list(server_url=group_url)
    print(f"Found {len(destinations.items or [])} destinations")

    # List all pipelines
    pipelines = ccp_client.pipelines.list(server_url=group_url)
    print(f"Found {len(pipelines.items or [])} pipelines")
```

The same SDK client can also be used to make asynchronous requests by importing asyncio.

```python
# Asynchronous Example
import asyncio
from cribl_control_plane import CriblControlPlane, models
import os

async def main():
    async with CriblControlPlane(
        server_url="https://api.example.com",
        security=models.Security(
            bearer_auth=os.getenv("CRIBLCONTROLPLANE_BEARER_AUTH", ""),
        ),
    ) as ccp_client:
        # Check server health
        health = await ccp_client.health.get_async()
        print(f"Server health: {health}")

        worker_group_id = "my-worker-group"
        group_url = f"https://api.example.com/m/{worker_group_id}"

        # List all sources
        sources = await ccp_client.sources.list_async(server_url=group_url)
        print(f"Found {len(sources.items or [])} sources")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Authentication

Except for the `health.get` and `auth.tokens.get` methods, all Cribl SDK requests require you to authenticate with a Bearer token. You must include a valid Bearer token in the configuration when initializing your SDK client. The Bearer token verifies your identity and ensures secure access to the requested resources. The SDK automatically manages the `Authorization` header for subsequent requests once properly authenticated.

For information about Bearer token expiration, see [Token Management](https://docs.cribl.io/cribl-as-code/sdks-auth/#sdks-token-mgmt) in the Cribl as Code documentation.

**Authentication happens once during SDK initialization**. After you initialize the SDK client with authentication as shown in the [authentication examples](https://github.com/criblio/cribl_control_plane_sdk_python/blob/master/#authentication-examples), the SDK automatically handles authentication for all subsequent API calls. You do not need to include authentication parameters in individual API requests. The [SDK Example Usage](https://github.com/criblio/cribl_control_plane_sdk_python/blob/master/#sdk-example-usage) section shows how to initialize the SDK and make API calls, but if you've properly initialized your client as shown in the authentication examples, you only need to make the API method calls themselves without re-initializing.

### Per-Client Security Schemes

This SDK supports the following security schemes globally:

| Name           | Type   | Scheme       | Environment Variable             |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `bearer_auth`  | http   | HTTP Bearer  | `CRIBLCONTROLPLANE_BEARER_AUTH`  |
| `client_oauth` | oauth2 | OAuth2 token | `CRIBLCONTROLPLANE_CLIENT_OAUTH` |

To configure authentication on Cribl.Cloud and in hybrid deployments, use the `client_oauth` security scheme. The SDK uses the OAuth credentials that you provide to obtain a Bearer token and refresh the token within its expiration window using the standard OAuth2 flow.

In on-prem deployments, use the `bearer_auth` security scheme. The SDK uses the username/password credentials that you provide to obtain a Bearer token. Automatically refreshing the Bearer token within its expiration window requires a callback function as shown in the [On-Prem Authentication Example](https://github.com/criblio/cribl_control_plane_sdk_python/blob/main/examples/example_onprem_auth.py).

Set the security scheme through the `security` optional parameter when initializing the SDK client instance. The SDK uses the selected scheme by default to authenticate with the API for all operations that support it.

### Authentication Examples

The [Cribl.Cloud and Hybrid Authentication Example](https://github.com/criblio/cribl_control_plane_sdk_python/blob/main/examples/example_cloud_auth.py) demonstrates how to configure authentication on Cribl.Cloud and in hybrid deployments. To obtain the Client ID and Client Secret you'll need to initialize using the `client_oauth` security schema, follow the [instructions for creating an API Credential](https://docs.cribl.io/cribl-as-code/sdks-auth/#sdks-auth-cloud) in the Cribl as Code documentation.

The [On-Prem Authentication Example](https://github.com/criblio/cribl_control_plane_sdk_python/blob/main/examples/example_onprem_auth.py) demonstrates how to configure authentication in on-prem deployments using your username and password.

## File uploads

Certain SDK methods accept file objects as part of a request body or multi-part request. It is possible and typically recommended to upload files as a stream rather than reading the entire contents into memory. This avoids excessive memory consumption and potentially crashing with out-of-memory errors when working with very large files. The following example demonstrates how to attach a file stream to a request.

> [!TIP]
>
> For endpoints that handle file uploads bytes arrays can also be used. However, using streams is recommended for large files.

) as ccp_client:

    res = ccp_client.packs.upload(filename="example.file", request_body=open("example.file", "rb"))

    # Handle response
    print(res)

```
<!-- End File uploads [file-upload] -->

## Retries

Some of the endpoints in this SDK support retries. If you use the SDK without any configuration, it will fall back to the default retry strategy provided by the API. However, the default retry strategy can be overridden on a per-operation basis, or across the entire SDK.

To change the default retry strategy for a single API call, simply provide a `RetryConfig` object to the call:
```python
from cribl_control_plane import CriblControlPlane, models
from cribl_control_plane.utils import BackoffStrategy, RetryConfig
import os

with CriblControlPlane(
    server_url="https://api.example.com",
    security=models.Security(
        bearer_auth=os.getenv("CRIBLCONTROLPLANE_BEARER_AUTH", ""),
    ),
) as ccp_client:
    retry_config = RetryConfig("backoff", BackoffStrategy(1, 50, 1.1, 100), False)
    res = ccp_client.sources.list(server_url="https://api.example.com/m/my-group", retry_config=retry_config)
    print(res)
```

If you'd like to override the default retry strategy for all operations that support retries, you can use the `retry_config` optional parameter when initializing the SDK:
```python
from cribl_control_plane import CriblControlPlane, models
from cribl_control_plane.utils import BackoffStrategy, RetryConfig
import os

with CriblControlPlane(
    server_url="https://api.example.com",
    retry_config=RetryConfig("backoff", BackoffStrategy(1, 50, 1.1, 100), False),
    security=models.Security(
        bearer_auth=os.getenv("CRIBLCONTROLPLANE_BEARER_AUTH", ""),
    ),
) as ccp_client:
    res = ccp_client.sources.list(server_url="https://api.example.com/m/my-group")
    print(res)
```
<!-- No End Retries [retries] -->

## Error Handling

[`CriblControlPlaneError`](https://github.com/criblio/cribl_control_plane_sdk_python/blob/master/./src/cribl_control_plane/errors/criblcontrolplaneerror.py) is the base class for all HTTP error responses. It has the following properties:

| Property           | Type             | Description                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `err.message`      | `str`            | Error message                                                                           |
| `err.status_code`  | `int`            | HTTP response status code eg `404`                                                      |
| `err.headers`      | `httpx.Headers`  | HTTP response headers                                                                   |
| `err.body`         | `str`            | HTTP body. Can be empty string if no body is returned.                                  |
| `err.raw_response` | `httpx.Response` | Raw HTTP response                                                                       |
| `err.data`         |                  | Optional. Some errors may contain structured data. [See Error Classes](https://github.com/criblio/cribl_control_plane_sdk_python/blob/master/#error-classes). |

    res = None
    try:
        res = ccp_client.sources.list(server_url="https://api.example.com/m/my-group")
        print(res)
    except errors.CriblControlPlaneError as e:
        # The base class for HTTP error responses
        print(e.message)
        print(e.status_code)
        print(e.body)
        print(e.headers)
        print(e.raw_response)

        # Depending on the method different errors may be thrown

<!-- Start Custom HTTP Client [http-client] -->
## Custom HTTP Client

The Python SDK makes API calls using the [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/) HTTP library.  In order to provide a convenient way to configure timeouts, cookies, proxies, custom headers, and other low-level configuration, you can initialize the SDK client with your own HTTP client instance.
Depending on whether you are using the sync or async version of the SDK, you can pass an instance of `HttpClient` or `AsyncHttpClient` respectively, which are Protocol's ensuring that the client has the necessary methods to make API calls.
This allows you to wrap the client with your own custom logic, such as adding custom headers, logging, or error handling, or you can just pass an instance of `httpx.Client` or `httpx.AsyncClient` directly.

For example, you could specify a header for every request that this sdk makes as follows:
```python
from cribl_control_plane import CriblControlPlane
import httpx

http_client = httpx.Client(headers={"x-custom-header": "someValue"})
s = CriblControlPlane(client=http_client)
```

or you could wrap the client with your own custom logic:
```python
from cribl_control_plane import CriblControlPlane
from cribl_control_plane.httpclient import AsyncHttpClient
import httpx

class CustomClient(AsyncHttpClient):
    client: AsyncHttpClient

    def __init__(self, client: AsyncHttpClient):
        self.client = client

    async def send(
        self,
        request: httpx.Request,
        *,
        stream: bool = False,
        auth: Union[
            httpx._types.AuthTypes, httpx._client.UseClientDefault, None
        ] = httpx.USE_CLIENT_DEFAULT,
        follow_redirects: Union[
            bool, httpx._client.UseClientDefault
        ] = httpx.USE_CLIENT_DEFAULT,
    ) -> httpx.Response:
        request.headers["Client-Level-Header"] = "added by client"

        return await self.client.send(
            request, stream=stream, auth=auth, follow_redirects=follow_redirects
        )

    def build_request(
        self,
        method: str,
        url: httpx._types.URLTypes,
        *,
        content: Optional[httpx._types.RequestContent] = None,
        data: Optional[httpx._types.RequestData] = None,
        files: Optional[httpx._types.RequestFiles] = None,
        json: Optional[Any] = None,
        params: Optional[httpx._types.QueryParamTypes] = None,
        headers: Optional[httpx._types.HeaderTypes] = None,
        cookies: Optional[httpx._types.CookieTypes] = None,
        timeout: Union[
            httpx._types.TimeoutTypes, httpx._client.UseClientDefault
        ] = httpx.USE_CLIENT_DEFAULT,
        extensions: Optional[httpx._types.RequestExtensions] = None,
    ) -> httpx.Request:
        return self.client.build_request(
            method,
            url,
            content=content,
            data=data,
            files=files,
            json=json,
            params=params,
            headers=headers,
            cookies=cookies,
            timeout=timeout,
            extensions=extensions,
        )

s = CriblControlPlane(async_client=CustomClient(httpx.AsyncClient()))
```
<!-- End Custom HTTP Client [http-client] -->

<!-- Start Resource Management [resource-management] -->
## Resource Management

The `CriblControlPlane` class implements the context manager protocol and registers a finalizer function to close the underlying sync and async HTTPX clients it uses under the hood. This will close HTTP connections, release memory and free up other resources held by the SDK. In short-lived Python programs and notebooks that make a few SDK method calls, resource management may not be a concern. However, in longer-lived programs, it is beneficial to create a single SDK instance via a [context manager][context-manager] and reuse it across the application.

[context-manager]: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#context-managers

```python
from cribl_control_plane import CriblControlPlane, models
import os
def main():

    with CriblControlPlane(
        server_url="https://api.example.com",
        security=models.Security(
            bearer_auth=os.getenv("CRIBLCONTROLPLANE_BEARER_AUTH", ""),
        ),
    ) as ccp_client:
        # Rest of application here...


# Or when using async:
async def amain():

    async with CriblControlPlane(
        server_url="https://api.example.com",
        security=models.Security(
            bearer_auth=os.getenv("CRIBLCONTROLPLANE_BEARER_AUTH", ""),
        ),
    ) as ccp_client:
        # Rest of application here...
```
<!-- End Resource Management [resource-management] -->

<!-- Start Debugging [debug] -->
## Debugging

You can setup your SDK to emit debug logs for SDK requests and responses.

You can pass your own logger class directly into your SDK.
```python
from cribl_control_plane import CriblControlPlane
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
s = CriblControlPlane(server_url="https://example.com", debug_logger=logging.getLogger("cribl_control_plane"))
```

You can also enable a default debug logger by setting an environment variable `CRIBLCONTROLPLANE_DEBUG` to true.
