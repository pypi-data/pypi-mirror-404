## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation for this package, including API reference and usage guides, can be found [here](https://bambutools.github.io/bambulabs_api/).

## Installation

To install the package, use `pip`:

```bash
pip install bambulabs_api
```

Make sure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed.

## Features

- **Connect and control** BambuLab 3D printers programmatically.
- **Monitor printer status** in real-time.
- **Execute commands** and manage print jobs directly through Python code.
- **Easy setup** and integration with Python environments.

## Usage Example

Below is a basic example demonstrating how to connect to a BambuLab 3D printer and retrieve its status using the API:

```python
import time
import bambulabs_api as bl

IP = '192.168.1.200'
SERIAL = 'AC12309BH109'
ACCESS_CODE = '12347890'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print('Starting bambulabs_api example')
    print('Connecting to BambuLab 3D printer')
    print(f'IP: {IP}')
    print(f'Serial: {SERIAL}')
    print(f'Access Code: {ACCESS_CODE}')

    # Create a new instance of the API
    printer = bl.Printer(IP, ACCESS_CODE, SERIAL)

    # Connect to the BambuLab 3D printer
    printer.connect()

    time.sleep(2)

    # Get the printer status
    status = printer.get_state()
    print(f'Printer status: {status}')

    # Turn the light off
    printer.turn_light_off()

    time.sleep(2)

    # Turn the light on
    printer.turn_light_on()

    # Disconnect from the Bambulabs 3D printer
    printer.disconnect()
```

## Known Limitations

* X1 Printers are not fully supported yet - camera integration is not yet implemented (for api versions < 2.7.0 please see the [No Camera Example](https://bambutools.github.io/bambulabs_api/examples.html#basic-no-camera)).
* H2D printers have not been tested yet.


## Development

If you want to contribute to the development of this API or run it in a development environment, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Conda**: Make sure you have Conda installed on your system.
- **Git**: Ensure Git is installed for cloning the repository.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BambuTools/bambulabs_api.git
   ```

2. Change directory:

   ```bash
   cd bambulabs_api
   ```

3. Create the Conda environment using the provided `environment.yml` file:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

   Note: Apple M chip workaround
   The binary for myst_parser is not available for M1 devices yet, as a workaround
   - Delete myst_parser from environment.yml
   - run `conda env create -f environment.yml`
   - Execute step 4 then run `pip install myst_parser`

4. Activate the environment:

   ```bash
   conda activate bl_api
   ```

5. Install the package in development mode:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

### Running Tests

To ensure everything is working correctly, you can run the tests using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest
```
