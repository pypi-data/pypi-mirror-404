# Application Logic

**Status**: ⏳ PROPOSED

**Structural Tension**
- Desired Outcome: {What users create through application workflows}
- Current Reality: {Current workflow capabilities}
- Natural Progression: {How workflows advance toward creation}

> Governed by: `rispecs/Creative_Orientation_Operating_Guide.md`

## Overview

This document specifies the procedural logic and workflows within `{PROJECT_NAME}`. Each workflow is designed as an advancing pattern that naturally progresses toward user-created outcomes.

---

## Workflow Index

| Workflow | Purpose | Entry Point |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| {workflow} | {What it enables users to create} | `{code_path}` |

---

## Core Workflows

### Workflow: {Name}

**Structural Tension**
- Desired Outcome: {What user wants to create}
- Current Reality: {Starting state}
- Natural Progression: {How workflow advances}

**Entry Point**: `{code_path}`

**Advancement Pattern:**

```
Step 1: {Description}
    ↓
Step 2: {Description}
    ↓
Step 3: {Description}
    ↓
[Created Outcome]: {What is manifested}
```

**Key Functions:**

| Function | Purpose | Returns |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `{function}` | {What it creates/enables} | `{type}` |

**Error Handling:**
- Errors are surfaced as observations, not problems
- Recovery paths enable continued advancement

### Workflow: {Name 2}

{Repeat structure...}

---

## State Transitions

State changes follow advancing patterns:

```
[Initial State] --action--> [Advancing State] --action--> [Created Outcome]
```

| Current State | Action | Next State | What Advances |
|---------------|--------|------------|---------------|
| `{state}` | `{action}` | `{state}` | {Creation progress} |

---

## Integration Points

External systems that support creation:

| System | Integration Type | Purpose |
|--------|------------------|---------|
| {system} | {type} | {What it enables} |
