## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Purpose

Execute Phase R3 of the RISE Framework: Export Optimization

Transform R2 specifications into optimized views for different audiences:
- **Technical Documentation** - For developers and architects
- **Stakeholder Communication** - For business and product teams
- **User Experience** - For design and UX teams
- **Agent-Oriented** - For multi-agent AI workflows

Each export preserves structural dynamics and creative advancement patterns while adapting presentation for the audience.

## Prerequisites

R3 assumes completed R2 (Specify) phase. Check for:
- `spec.md` - Main specification
- `creative-advancement-scenarios.md` - CAS documentation
- R1 artifacts (for beloved qualities reference)

If R2 artifacts don't exist, recommend running `/rispec.specify` first.

## Structural Constraints for All Agents

All agent work must:
1. Preserve identified beloved qualities
2. Maintain creative orientation language
3. Support advancing patterns, not oscillating
4. Reference structural tension dynamics

## Quality Validation

Before marking task complete, verify:
- [ ] Creative orientation preserved
- [ ] Structural dynamics explicit
- [ ] Advancing patterns supported
- [ ] No reactive language introduced
```

## Process

1. **Identify Export Requirements**
   From user input, determine:
   - Which export types needed
   - Specific audience customizations
   - Priority order

2. **Load Source Artifacts**
   - R2 specifications
   - R1 creative archaeology
   - R0 structural observations (if needed)

3. **Generate Exports**
   For each requested export type:
   
   a. Apply audience-appropriate lens
   b. Transform specifications while preserving:
      - Structural dynamics
      - Creative orientation
      - Beloved qualities
      - Advancing patterns
   
   c. Validate export quality

4. **Create Export Artifacts**
   Store in appropriate locations:
   - `exports/technical/` - Technical documentation
   - `exports/stakeholder/` - Business communication
   - `exports/ux/` - User experience specs
   - `exports/agents/` - Agent task specs

## Completion

When R3 is complete:
1. Requested export types are generated
2. Structural dynamics preserved in all views
3. Creative orientation maintained across audiences
4. Exports are ready for distribution

Report: "R3 Export complete. [N] export types generated."

If ongoing maintenance needed, offer handoff to `/rispec.evolve` for R4 (Living Spec Evolution).
