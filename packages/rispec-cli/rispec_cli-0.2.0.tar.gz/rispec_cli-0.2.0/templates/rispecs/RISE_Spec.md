# {PROJECT_NAME}: A RISE-Based Specification

**Status**: ⏳ PROPOSED

> Operating Governance: This specification is governed by `rispecs/Creative_Orientation_Operating_Guide.md`. Include the following blocks in top-level docs and agent outputs: Structural Tension, Observations (neutral), Structural Assessment, and optional Advancing Moves.

**Structural Tension**
- Desired Outcome: {Describe what users want to create through this application}
- Current Reality: {Describe current state and capabilities}
- Natural Progression: {Describe how structure naturally advances toward the outcome}

This document provides a creative-oriented specification for the `{PROJECT_NAME}` application, following the principles of the RISE Framework. It focuses on what the application empowers users to create, the structural dynamics that enable this creation, and the advancing patterns that guide the process.

For details on specific aspects, refer to:
- `Prompts.md` (if applicable)
- `DataSchemas.md`
- `Configuration.md`
- `ImplementationNotes.md`

## 1. Core Creative Intent

The fundamental purpose of `{PROJECT_NAME}` is to **{describe what users are empowered to create}**.

{Describe the core creative purpose in creation-focused language. Avoid problem-elimination framing.}

## 2. The Central Structural Tension

The application's entire workflow is driven by the structural tension between the user's initial state and their desired outcome.

* **Current Reality:** {What users start with - their initial state, resources, constraints}

* **Desired Outcome:** {What users want to create or achieve - the manifested result}

The `{PROJECT_NAME}` application is the system designed to resolve this tension. Every feature and workflow step is a component of the structure that enables natural progression from `Current Reality` to `Desired Outcome`.

## 3. Creative Advancement Scenarios

The application resolves this tension through a series of advancing patterns, which can be described as Creative Advancement Scenarios. Each scenario represents a major stage in the journey from initial state to manifested outcome.

---

### Scenario 1: {First Major User Journey}

This scenario describes {brief description of what this scenario accomplishes}.

**Desired Outcome:** {What the user wants to create through this scenario}

**Current Reality:** {Where the user starts for this scenario}

**Natural Progression:** {How the system structure guides advancement}

**Resolution:** {What is created/manifested when this scenario completes}

**Advancement Pattern Steps:**

1. **{Step Name}:** {Description of what happens and how it advances toward the outcome}
   - Supporting Feature: {Feature/component that enables this step}

2. **{Step Name}:** {Description}
   - Supporting Feature: {Feature/component}

3. **{Step Name}:** {Description}
   - Supporting Feature: {Feature/component}

---

### Scenario 2: {Second Major User Journey}

{Repeat structure for additional scenarios...}

---

## 4. Feature Inventory (Creation-Focused)

### Vision-Supporting Features
Features that help users **clarify desired outcomes**:
- {Feature}: {How it supports vision clarification}

### Tension-Resolving Features
Features that **facilitate natural progression** toward goals:
- {Feature}: {How it enables advancement}

### Manifestation Features
Features that **directly support creation** of desired results:
- {Feature}: {How it supports actual creation}

## 5. Beloved Qualities

Qualities users cherish about this system that must be preserved:
- **{Quality}**: {Description of what makes this beloved}

## 6. Advancing vs Oscillating Patterns

### Advancing Patterns (PRESERVE)
- {Pattern}: {How it consistently moves toward outcomes}

### Oscillating Patterns (REDESIGN)
- {Pattern}: {The back-and-forth cycle and how to convert it to advancing}
