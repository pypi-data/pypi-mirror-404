Classes for modeling self-limited surface processes.

This module implements the core chemistry models for atomic layer deposition (ALD)
and other self-limited surface reactions. The primary classes are:

- **Precursor**: Defines precursor molecules with properties like mass and thermal velocity
- **ALDchem**: Defines an ideal first-order Langmuir kinetics with optional second pathway and surface recombination
- **ALDideal**: Ideal first-order Langmuir kinetics with single sticking probability
- **ALDsoft**: Dual-pathway Langmuir kinetics for modeling soft saturation behavior

These classes provide the foundation for simulating coverage-dependent surface kinetics,
saturation curves, and characteristic timescales of self-limited processes.

class ALDideal(SurfaceKinetics):
    """
    Ideal first-order irreversible Langmuir kinetics for atomic layer deposition.

    This class implements a surface kinetics model for ALD processes where precursor
    molecules undergo chemisorption on reactive surface sites. The model accounts for
    both direct sticking and recombination pathways, with coverage-dependent probabilities.

    The model assumes:
    - First-order Langmuir adsorption kinetics
    - Self-limiting surface reactions
    - Uniform reactive sites with equal surface area
    - Coverage-dependent recombination, with different values depending on the state of the site

    Parameters
    ----------
    prec : Precursor
        The precursor molecule for this half-reaction. Contains properties like
        molecular mass needed to calculate thermal velocity and wall flux.
    nsites : float
        Number of reactive sites per unit surface area (sites/m²). This determines
        the site area via the relationship: site_area = f / nsites.
    p_stick : float
        Sticking probability (0 ≤ p_stick ≤ 1) for precursor molecules
        interacting with bare reactive sites. Represents the probability that a
        gas-phase molecule chemisorbs upon collision with an unreacted site.
    p_rec0 : float, optional
        Recombination probability on bare sites (default: 0). This is the probability
        that a precursor molecule reacts via recombination with the bare surface, for
        instance in the case of plasma species.
    p_rec1 : float, optional
        Recombination probability on fully reacted sites (default: 0). This is the
        probability of recombination when the surface is saturated (coverage = 1).
        The actual recombination probability varies linearly with coverage between
        p_rec0 and p_rec1.
    f : float, optional
        Fraction of the surface that is reactive (0 < f ≤ 1, default: 1). For f < 1,
        only a portion of the surface contains reactive sites.

class ALDsoft(SurfaceKinetics):
    """
    First-order irreversible Langmuir kinetics with two independent reaction pathways.

    This class extends the ideal ALD kinetics model to account for surface heterogeneity
    by considering two distinct types of reactive sites, each with different sticking
    probabilities. This dual-pathway model is useful for describing "soft saturation"
    behavior where different surface sites saturate at different rates.

    The model assumes:
    - Two independent populations of reactive sites (pathway 1 and pathway 2)
    - First-order Langmuir adsorption kinetics for each pathway
    - Self-limiting surface reactions on both pathways
    - Each pathway has uniform reactive sites with equal surface area
    - The fraction of unreactive sites is given by: f_unreactive = 1 - (f1 + f2)

    The main difference from ALDideal is that ALDsoft considers two separate reaction
    pathways with independent coverage evolution. f1 and f2 are the fractions of the
    surface sites for each pathway. Normally f1 + f2 = 1 unless there is a fraction
    of unreactive sites.

    Parameters
    ----------
    prec : Precursor
        The precursor molecule for this half-reaction. Contains properties like
        molecular mass needed to calculate thermal velocity and wall flux.
    nsites : float
        Number of reactive sites per unit surface area (sites/m²) for each pathway.
        This determines the site area via the relationship: site_area = (f1 + f2) / nsites.
    p_stick1 : float
        Sticking probability (0 ≤ p_stick1 ≤ 1) for precursor molecules interacting
        with bare reactive sites on pathway 1. Represents the probability that a
        gas-phase molecule chemisorbs upon collision with an unreacted site of type 1.
    p_stick2 : float
        Sticking probability (0 ≤ p_stick2 ≤ 1) for precursor molecules interacting
        with bare reactive sites on pathway 2. Typically p_stick2 ≠ p_stick1,
        leading to different saturation timescales for each pathway.
    f1 : float
        Fraction of the surface covered by pathway 1 reactive sites (0 < f1 ≤ 1).
        This represents the population of sites with sticking probability p_stick1.
    f2 : float, optional
        Fraction of the surface covered by pathway 2 reactive sites (0 < f2 ≤ 1).
        If not provided, defaults to (1 - f1), assuming no unreactive sites.
        For surfaces with unreactive sites, set f2 explicitly such that f1 + f2 < 1.

class ALDchem(SurfaceKinetics):
    """
    Self-limited irreversible first order Langmuir kinetics with optional second pathway and coverage-dependent recombination.

    This class models surfaces with one or two types
    of reactive sites (each with different sticking probabilities) while also
    accounting for recombination reactions on reacted sites.

    The model assumes:
    - One or two independent populations of reactive sites
    - First-order Langmuir adsorption kinetics for each pathway
    - Coverage-dependent recombination with the same probability for both pathways
    - Self-limiting surface reactions

    Parameters
    ----------
    prec : Precursor
        The precursor molecule for this half-reaction.
    nsites : float
        Number of reactive sites per unit surface area (sites/m2).
    p_stick1 : float
        Sticking probability for pathway 1 sites (0 ≤ p_stick1 ≤ 1).
    p_stick2 : float, optional
        Sticking probability for pathway 2 sites (0 ≤ p_stick2 ≤ 1, default: 0).
        If 0, only a single pathway is used.
    f1 : float, optional
        Fraction of the surface covered by pathway 1 reactive sites.
        Defaults to 1 if single pathway, or (1 - f2) if f2 is provided.
    f2 : float, optional
        Fraction of the surface covered by pathway 2 reactive sites (default: 0).
    p_rec0 : float, optional
        Recombination probability on bare sites (default: 0).
    p_rec1 : float, optional
        Recombination probability on fully reacted sites (default: 0).
        This same probability applies to both pathways.
    dm : float, optional
        Mass gain during the cycle (default: 1).
