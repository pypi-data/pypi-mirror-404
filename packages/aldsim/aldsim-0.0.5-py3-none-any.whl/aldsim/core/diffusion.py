class DiffusionVia:
    """Model for ALD in high aspect ratio circular vias.

    Implementation of a non-dimensional model for atomic layer deposition
    in high-aspect-ratio circular vias. The model uses a Knudsen diffusion transport
    model and self-limited surface reaction kinetics and surface recombination.

    The model assumes a first-order irreversible Langmuir kinetics
    with the sticking probability value determining the reaction rate.
    It also supports recombination processes on both bare and reacted
    surface sites.

    Parameters
    ----------
    AR : float
        Aspect ratio of the circular via (depth/diameter). Higher values
        indicate deeper, narrower structures where diffusion limitations
        become more significant. Must be non-negative.
    p_stick0 : float
        Sticking probability for the self-limited ALD process. Represents
        the probability that a precursor molecule will react when it
        encounters a surface site.
    p_rec0 : float, optional
        Recombination probability on bare (unreacted) surface sites.
        Default is 0.
    p_rec1 : float, optional
        Recombination probability on reacted surface sites. Default is 0.

    Attributes
    ----------
    AR : float
        The aspect ratio of the via.
    p_stick0 : float
        The sticking probability of the ALD process.
    p_rec0 : float
        The recombination probability on bare sites.
    p_rec1 : float
        The recombination probability on reacted sites.

    Examples
    --------
    Create a DiffusionVia model for a via with aspect ratio 10:

    >>> model = DiffusionVia(AR=10, p_stick0=0.05)
    >>> coverage, times = model.run(max_time=2.0)
    >>> print(f"Final mean coverage: {coverage[-1].mean():.3f}")

    Model with recombination effects:

    >>> model = DiffusionVia(AR=20, p_stick0=0.03, p_rec0=0.01, p_rec1=0.05)
    >>> coverage, times = model.run_until_cov(max_cov=0.95)
    >>> print(f"Time to reach 95% coverage: {times[-1]:.3f}")

    Notes
    -----
    The model uses Knudsen diffusion to describe precursor transport
    inside the circular via. The governing equations are solved using
    a finite difference method with banded matrix solver for efficiency.

    All time values in the model are normalized by a characteristic
    diffusion time scale.

        Parameters
        ----------
        N : int, optional
            Number of discretized segments along the via depth. If None
            (default), automatically calculated as 4 * AR to ensure adequate
            spatial resolution. Higher values provide better accuracy but
            increase computation time.
        max_time : float, optional
            Maximum normalized time for the simulation. Default is 1.0.
            Represents the duration of precursor exposure in normalized units.
            Must be positive.
        save_every : float, optional
            Normalized time interval at which coverage profiles are saved.
            Default is 0.2. Smaller values provide more time resolution but
            increase memory usage. Must be positive and less than max_time.
        dt : float, optional
            Time step size for numerical integration (dimensionless).
            Default is 0.05. Smaller values improve accuracy but increase

            from the entrance (index 0) to the bottom (index N-1). Values
            are bounded between 0 and 1.
        times : list of float
            List of normalized times corresponding to saved coverage profiles.
            Length matches the coverage list.

        --------
