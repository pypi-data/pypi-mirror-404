## x-evolution

Implementation of various evolutionary algorithms, starting with [evolutionary strategies](https://blog.otoro.net/2017/10/29/visual-evolution-strategies/)

## Install

```bash
$ pip install x-evolution
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from x_evolution import EvoStrategy

# model

from torch import nn
model = torch.nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(8, 16),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(16, 4)
)

# evolution wrapper

evo_strat = EvoStrategy(
    model,
    environment = lambda model: torch.randint(0, 100, ()), # environment is just a function that takes in the individual model (with unique noise) and outputs a scalar (the fitness) the measure you are selecting for
    noise_population_size = 30, # increase this for better gradient estimates
    noise_scale = 1e-2,         # the scale of the perturbation noise, also the initial noise scale (sigma) if `learned_noise_scale` = True
    num_generations = 100,    # number of generations / training steps
    learning_rate = 1e-3,     # scale on update derived by fitness and perturb noises
    params_to_optimize = None # defaults to all parameters, but can be [str {param name}] or [Parameter]
)

# do evolution with your desired fitness function for so many generations

evo_strat()

# model will be saved under checkpoints/ folder
# can also specify checkpoint_every at init and select the one with your favored fitness score for continued policy gradient learning etc
```

## Distributed

Using the CLI from 🤗 

```shell
$ accelerate config
```

Then

```shell
$ accelerate launch train.py
```

For gymnasium simulations, first run `pip install '[examples]'`
