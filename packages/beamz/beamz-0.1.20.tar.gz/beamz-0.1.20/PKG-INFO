BEAMZ is an **electromagnetic simulation** package using the FDTD method. It features a **high-level API** for fast prototyping with just a few lines of code as well as an **inverse design module** for topology optimization using the adjoint method with **Jax-based autodiff**. Made for (but not limited to) photonic integrated circuits.

```bash
uv pip install beamz
```

  Design your first gradient-optimized 90°-bend topology in under 5 min by copying the example script from this repo and running <code>uv run python examples/4_topology.py</code>.
  <span>This design predicts a high broadband transmission of &gt;98% from 1300&nbsp;nm to 1800&nbsp;nm.</span>
