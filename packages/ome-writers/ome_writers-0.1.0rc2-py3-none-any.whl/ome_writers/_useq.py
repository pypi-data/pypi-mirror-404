    """Convert a [`useq.MDASequence`][] to a list of [`Dimension`][ome_writers.Dimension] `|` [`PositionDimension`][ome_writers.PositionDimension] for ome-writers.

    !!! tip "Important"
        `useq-schema` has a very expressive API that can generate complex,
        irregular multi-dimensional acquisition sequences. However, not all of these
        patterns can be represented in a regular N-dimensional image data structure as
        used by OME-TIFF/OME-NGFF. Sequences that result in ragged dimensions will
        raise `NotImplementedError` when passed to this function.

    The following restrictions apply:

    **Grid and Position handling:**

    - Position and grid axes must be adjacent in axis_order (e.g., `"pgcz"`, not
      `"pcgz"`).
    - When both `stage_positions` and `grid_plan` are specified, position must come
      before grid in axis_order (e.g., "pgtcz" not "gptcz"). Grid-first order is only
      supported when using `grid_plan` alone without `stage_positions`.
    - Position subsequences may only contain a `grid_plan`, not time/channel/z-plans.
      Different positions *may* have different grid shapes.
    - If `stage_positions` is a `WellPlatePlan`, it cannot be
      combined with an outer `grid_plan`. Use `well_points_plan` on the `WellPlatePlan`
      instead.

    **Channel, Z, and Time handling:**

    - All channels must have the same `do_stack` value when a z_plan is present.
    - All channels must have `acquire_every=1`. Skipping timepoints on some channels
      creates ragged dimensions.
    - Unbounded time plans (duration-based plans with interval=0) are not supported.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seq : useq.MDASequence
        The `useq.MDASequence` to convert.
    image_width : int
        The expected width of the images in the stream.
    image_height : int
        The expected height of the images in the stream.
    units : Mapping[str, UnitTuple | None] | None, optional
        An optional mapping of dimension labels to their units.
    pixel_size_um : float | None, optional
        The size of a pixel in micrometers. If provided, it will be used to set the
        scale for the spatial dimensions.
    chunk_shapes : Mapping[str, int] | None, optional
        An optional mapping of dimension names ("tczyx") to their chunk sizes.
        (In number of pixels per chunk)
    shard_shapes : Mapping[str, int] | None, optional
        An optional mapping of dimension names ("tczyx") to their shard sizes
        (in number of chunks per shard)

    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If the sequence contains any of the unsupported patterns listed above.
