"""ArrayBackend protocol for ome-writers.

ArrayBackend defines the interface that format-specific writers must implement.
Backends are responsible for:

1. **Compatibility validation** - Determine if settings can be handled by this backend
2. **Preparation** - Initialize storage structure (buffers, directories, files)
3. **Writing** - Accept frames at specified locations
4. **Finalization** - Flush, close, and clean up resources

Design Notes
------------
Backends are intentionally simple adapters. They:

- Receive storage-order indices and don't need to know about acquisition order
- Don't own the FrameRouter - that's the orchestrator's responsibility
- May ignore the index parameter for sequential-only backends (TIFF, acquire-zarr)

The compatibility check (`is_compatible`) allows backend selection to fail fast
when settings don't match capabilities. For example:
- acquire-zarr cannot handle `storage_order != "acquisition"` (sequential writes)
- tifffile cannot handle `count=None` on first dimension (no resizing)

Example Usage
-------------
>>> from ome_writers._schema_pydantic import (
...     AcquisitionSettings,
...     dims_from_standard_axes,
... )
>>>
>>> settings = AcquisitionSettings(
...     root_path="/data/output.zarr",
...     arrays=ArraySettings(
...         dimensions=dims_from_standard_axes({"t": 10, "c": 2, "y": 512, "x": 512}),
...         dtype="uint16",
...     ),
... )
>>>
>>> backend = SomeConcreteBackend()
>>> if backend.is_incompatible(settings):
...     raise ValueError(backend.compatibility_error(settings))
>>>
>>> backend.prepare(settings, router)
>>> for pos_idx, idx in router:
...     frame = get_next_frame()
...     backend.write(pos_idx, idx, frame)
>>> backend.finalize()

        Parameters
        ----------
        settings
            Acquisition settings containing path, array settings, and options.
            The backend extracts `root_path`, `overwrite`, and array-specific
            settings (dimensions, dtype, chunking, etc.) from this object.
        router
            The FrameRouter that will be used for iteration. Backends can use
            `settings.positions` to get the list of Position objects to create.

        Raises
        ------
        FileExistsError
            If path exists and `settings.overwrite` is False.

            N-dimensional index in storage order (excludes Y/X spatial dims).
            Sequential backends may ignore this parameter.
        frame
            2D array (Y, X) containing the frame data.

        Returns the metadata that was auto-generated during prepare() based on
        dimensions, dtype, and other acquisition settings. Users can modify this
        object and pass it to update_metadata() to add acquisition-specific details.

        Returns
        -------
        metadata
            Format-specific metadata object. The exact type depends on the backend:
            - TIFF: `ome_types.model.OME` - single object with all positions
            - Zarr: `dict[str, dict]` - mapping of group paths to .zattrs dicts
            Returns None if backend doesn't support metadata retrieval.

        Notes
        -----
        The returned metadata is a "base" structure with generic names and
        dimension information. Modify it to add:
        - Meaningful image/channel names
        - Acquisition timestamps
        - Stage positions
        - Instrument details
        - Any other acquisition-specific metadata

        For TIFF, the returned ome.OME object contains all positions as Image
        objects with IDs "Image:0", "Image:1", etc.

        For Zarr, the returned dict has keys that are group paths relative to
        the root (e.g., "0", "1" for multi-position, or "A/1/field_0" for plates).
        Each value is a dict containing the .zattrs content, typically with keys:
        - "ome": yaozarrs v05.Image model (structured OME metadata)
        - "omero": dict with channel colors/names (if applicable)
        - Custom keys for non-standard metadata (timestamps, etc.)

        This optional hook allows updating file metadata after `finalize()`.
        The default implementation is a no-op. Backends that support post-hoc
        metadata updates (e.g., tifffile's `tiffcomment`) should override.

        Parameters
        ----------
        metadata
            Format-specific metadata object. The exact type depends on the
            backend (e.g., `ome_types.OME` for TIFF, `dict[str, dict]` for Zarr).

        Notes
        -----
        This method is typically called after `finalize()` when complete
        acquisition metadata is available (e.g., actual timestamps, stage
        positions recorded during acquisition).

        For convenience, use get_metadata() to retrieve the base structure,
        modify it, and pass it back to this method. This avoids duplicating
        dimension and dtype information.
