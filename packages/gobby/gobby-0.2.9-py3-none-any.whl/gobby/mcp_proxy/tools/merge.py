"""
Internal MCP tools for Gobby Merge Resolution.

Exposes functionality for:
- Starting merge operations with AI-powered resolution
- Getting merge status and conflict details
- Resolving individual conflicts
- Applying resolved merges
- Aborting merge operations

These tools are registered with the InternalToolRegistry and accessed
via the downstream proxy pattern (call_tool, list_tools, get_tool_schema).
