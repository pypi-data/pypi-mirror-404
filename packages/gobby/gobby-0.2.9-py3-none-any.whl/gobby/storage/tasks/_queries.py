"""Task query operations.

This module provides query operations for listing and filtering tasks:
- list_tasks: General task listing with filters
- list_ready_tasks: Tasks ready to work on (not blocked)
- list_blocked_tasks: Tasks blocked by dependencies
- list_workflow_tasks: Tasks associated with a workflow
