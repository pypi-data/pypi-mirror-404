Internal MCP tools for Gobby Worktree Management.

Exposes functionality for:
- Creating git worktrees for isolated development
- Managing worktree lifecycle (claim, release, cleanup)
- Syncing worktrees with main branch
- Spawning agents in worktrees

These tools are registered with the InternalToolRegistry and accessed
via the downstream proxy pattern (call_tool, list_tools, get_tool_schema).
