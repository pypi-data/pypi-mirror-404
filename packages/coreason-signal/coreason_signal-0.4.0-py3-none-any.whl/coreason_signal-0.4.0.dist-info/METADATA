# coreason-signal

**The Edge Intelligence Gateway for the CoReason Ecosystem.**

**coreason-signal** transforms laboratory instruments from passive data loggers into active participants. It acts as the "nervous system" of the Self-Driving Lab, bridging the gap between cloud-based reasoning and physical hardware.

## Features

- **Edge Agentic AI (Micro-Cortex):** Deploys Micro-LLMs locally to parse error logs, query local SOPs via RAG, and trigger autonomous recovery actions (e.g., retrying failed aspirations).
- **Soft Sensing (Virtual Metrology):** Uses Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to infer invisible biological states (like cell viability) from real-time physical sensor data.
- **Protocol Polyglot:** Natively supports **SiLA 2** (Standard in Lab Automation) while wrapping legacy serial and analog instruments (via Computer Vision) into clean microservices.
- **Live Digital Twin:** Syncs physical state to the CoReason Knowledge Graph with sub-second latency using delta updates.
- **High-Throughput Streaming:** Leverages **Apache Arrow Flight** for efficient transmission of high-frequency waveform data.
- **Management Control Plane:** A RESTful API (FastAPI) for remote status monitoring, soft sensor configuration, and manual reflex triggering.

For detailed requirements and architecture, see [Product Requirements](docs/product_requirements.md).

## Installation

```bash
pip install coreason-signal
```

## Usage

**See the full [Usage Guide](docs/usage.md) for details on the REST API and CLI.**

To start the Edge Intelligence Gateway:

```bash
poetry run start serve
```

This launches the service, including the SiLA 2 Server, Arrow Flight Stream, and the **Management API** on port `8000`.
