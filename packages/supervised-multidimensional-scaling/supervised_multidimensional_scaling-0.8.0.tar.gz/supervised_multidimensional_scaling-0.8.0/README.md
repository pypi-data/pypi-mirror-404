This is a stand-alone implementation of Supervised Multi-Dimensional Scaling (SMDS) from the paper "Shape Happens: Automatic Feature Manifold Discovery in LLMs". It contains a plug-and-play class written with the familiar [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) interface. SMDS supports several template shapes to discover manifolds of various forms.

## Getting started

With uv (recommended):
```shell
uv add supervised-multidimensional-scaling
```

With pip:
```bash
pip install supervised-multidimensional-scaling
```

## Usage

The `SupervisedMDS` class provides a scikit-learn style interface that is straightforward to use. Unlike standard MDS, it requires a target `manifold` shape (e.g., `ClusterShape`, `CircularShape`) to define the ideal geometry.

### Fit & Transform

You can instantiate the model, fit it to data `(X, y)`, and transform your input into a low-dimensional embedding:

```python
import numpy as np
from smds import SupervisedMDS
from smds.shapes import ClusterShape

# Example data
X = np.random.randn(100, 20)   # 100 samples, 20 features
y = np.random.randint(0, 5, size=100)  # Discrete labels (clusters)

# Instantiate and fit
# manifold can be any class inheriting from BaseShape
smds = SupervisedMDS(n_components=2, manifold=ClusterShape(), alpha=0.1)
smds.fit(X, y)

# Transform to low-dimensional space
X_proj = smds.transform(X)
print(X_proj.shape)  # (100, 2)
```

### Manifold Discovery

The library provided a high level pipeline to automatically discover the intrinsic manifold of your data. The `discover_manifolds` utility evaluates a set of hypothesis shapes (for example: clusters, circles, hierarchies) and ranks them based on how well they explain the data structure using cross validation.

```python
from smds.pipeline.discovery_pipeline import discover_manifolds
from smds.pipeline import open_dashboard

# Run discovery pipeline
# Evaluates default shapes (Cluster, Circular, Hierarchical, etc.)
# Returns a DataFrame sorted by best fit (lowest stress / highest score)
df_results, save_path = discover_manifolds(
    X, 
    y, 
    smds_components=2,           # Target dimensionality
    n_folds=5,                   # Cross-validation folds
    experiment_name="My_Exp",    # Name for saved results
    n_jobs=-1                    # Use all available cores
)

print(f"Best matching shape: {df_results.iloc[0]['shape']}")
print(df_results.head())

# Launch the interactive Streamlit dashboard to explore results and plots
open_dashboard.main(save_path)
```

The discovery pipeline handles:
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Iterates through a default or custom list of manifold shapes.
- **Cross-Validation**: Uses k-fold CV to ensure robust scoring.
- **Caching**: Caches intermediate results to resume interrupted experiments.
- **Visualization**: Generates interactive plots for the dashboard.

## Development

This seciton is especially usefull if you consider contributing to the library!

### Documentation

To build and serve the documentation locally:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `dev` dependency group includes heavy libraries such as `torch` and `transformers`.


### Testing

Run the test suite using pytest:

```bash
make test
```
