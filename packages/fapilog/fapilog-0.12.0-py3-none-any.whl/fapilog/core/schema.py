"""
Shared type definitions for the canonical log schema v1.1.

These TypedDict definitions provide:
1. Static type checking via mypy
2. IDE autocomplete for schema fields
3. Documentation of the expected structure
4. Single source of truth for producer/consumer contracts

The v1.1 schema organizes fields into semantic groupings:
- context: Request/trace identifiers (WHO and WHAT request)
- diagnostics: Runtime/operational data (WHERE and system state)
- data: User-provided structured data
