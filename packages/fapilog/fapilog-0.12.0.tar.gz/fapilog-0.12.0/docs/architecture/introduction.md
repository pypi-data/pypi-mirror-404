# Introduction

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Decision:** N/A - Complete greenfield development with no starter templates, building a Python library from scratch.

**Analysis from your project:**

- This is a Python library (not a web application)
- Current structure suggests you're building from scratch
- Focus is on async-first architecture patterns
- CLI components for tooling
