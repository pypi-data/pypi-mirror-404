# Xinference Restful Client
Xinference provides a restful client for managing and accessing models programmatically.

## Install
```shell
pip install xinference-client
```

## Usage
```python
from xinference_client import RESTfulClient as Client

client = Client("http://localhost:9997")
model_uid = client.launch_model(model_name="chatglm2")
model = client.get_model(model_uid)

chat_history = []
prompt = "What is the largest animal?"
model.chat(
    prompt,
    chat_history=chat_history,
    generate_config={"max_tokens": 1024}
)
```
Result:
```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-8d76b65a-bad0-42ef-912d-4a0533d90d61",

However, it is important to note that this is just an estimate and that the largest animal known to science may be larger still. Some scientists believe that the largest animals may not have a clear \"size\" in the same way that humans do, as their size can vary depending on the environment and the stage of their life."
