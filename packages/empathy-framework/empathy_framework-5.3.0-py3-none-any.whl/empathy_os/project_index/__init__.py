"""Project Index - Codebase Intelligence Layer

Tracks metadata about all files in a project to enable:
- Test coverage gap analysis
- Staleness detection (code changed, tests didn't)
- Dependency mapping
- Project health reports
- Workflow intelligence

Storage:
- Primary: .empathy/project_index.json
- Real-time: Redis (when short-term memory enabled)
