"""Parallel Project Scanner - Multi-core optimized file scanning.

This module provides a parallel implementation of ProjectScanner using
multiprocessing to distribute file analysis across CPU cores.

Expected speedup: 3-4x on quad-core machines for large codebases (>1000 files).

Usage:
    from empathy_os.project_index.scanner_parallel import ParallelProjectScanner

    scanner = ParallelProjectScanner(project_root=".", workers=4)
    records, summary = scanner.scan()

        workers: Number of worker processes (default: CPU count)

    Performance:
        - Sequential: ~9.2s for 3,469 files (375 files/sec)
        - Parallel (4 workers): ~2.5s expected (1,387 files/sec)

    Memory:
        - Each worker creates its own scanner instance
        - Peak memory scales with worker count
        - Expected: 2x-3x memory usage vs sequential
