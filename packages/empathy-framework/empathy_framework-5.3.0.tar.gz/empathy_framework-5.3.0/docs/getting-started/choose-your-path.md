# Choose Your Path

You've installed the framework and run your first workflow. Now choose the approach that fits your needs.

## Four Ways to Use Empathy Framework

| Path | Best For | Complexity |
|------|----------|------------|
| [CLI Power User](#path-1-cli-power-user) | Quick tasks, automation, CI/CD | Simple |
| [MCP Integration](#path-2-mcp-integration) | Claude Desktop, conversational workflow building | Simple |
| [Workflow Developer](#path-3-workflow-developer) | Custom automations, Python integration | Moderate |
| [Meta-Orchestration](#path-4-meta-orchestration) | Complex tasks, multi-agent teams | Advanced |

---

## Path 1: CLI Power User

**Best for:** Quick tasks, shell scripts, CI/CD pipelines

Use the `empathy` CLI to run pre-built workflows without writing Python.

### Key Commands

```bash
# Run workflows
empathy workflow run security-audit --path ./src
empathy workflow run bug-predict --path ./src
empathy workflow run release-prep --path .

# Track costs
empathy telemetry show
empathy telemetry savings --days 30
```

## Path 2: MCP Integration

**Best for:** Claude Desktop users, conversational workflow building

Connect to Claude Desktop or any MCP-compatible client for guided workflow creation.

### Quick Setup

Add to Claude Desktop config:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "socratic": {
            "command": "python",
            "args": ["-m", "empathy_os.socratic.mcp_server"],
            "env": {"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "your-key"}
        }
    }
}
```

Then ask Claude to help you build workflows conversationally.

## Path 3: Workflow Developer

**Best for:** Custom automations, integrating AI into Python apps

Use the Python API to run and build workflows.

### Using Built-in Workflows

```python
from empathy_os.workflows import SecurityAuditWorkflow
import asyncio

async def audit():
    workflow = SecurityAuditWorkflow()
    result = await workflow.execute(target_path="./src")
    print(f"Found {len(result.findings)} issues")

asyncio.run(audit())
```

---

## Path 4: Meta-Orchestration

**Best for:** Complex tasks needing multiple AI agents

Describe what you want and let the framework compose agent teams.

```python
from empathy_os.orchestration import MetaOrchestrator

orchestrator = MetaOrchestrator()
plan = orchestrator.analyze_and_compose(
    task="Review code for security and suggest performance improvements",
    context={"path": "./src"}
)
result = await orchestrator.execute(plan)
```

## Still Not Sure?

| If you want to... | Start with... |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Run quick tasks from terminal | CLI |
| Use Claude Desktop | MCP Integration |
| Build custom Python apps | Workflow Developer |
| Orchestrate complex multi-agent tasks | Meta-Orchestration |

**Most users start with CLI or MCP.** Move to Workflow Developer when you need custom logic, and Meta-Orchestration when tasks get complex.
