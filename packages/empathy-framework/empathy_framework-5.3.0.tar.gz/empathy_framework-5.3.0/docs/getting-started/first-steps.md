# First Steps

Run your first AI workflow and see results in under 5 minutes.

---

## Your First Workflow

Let's run a **security audit** on some code. This workflow scans for vulnerabilities and provides actionable recommendations.

### Option 1: CLI (Fastest)

```bash
# Scan your source directory
empathy workflow run security-audit --path ./src

# Or scan current directory
empathy workflow run security-audit --path .
```

**Example output:**
```
Security Audit Results
======================
Status: completed
Findings: 3

[HIGH] SQL query vulnerable to injection
  File: src/database.py:45
  Fix: Use parameterized queries

[MEDIUM] Hardcoded API key in config
  File: src/config.py:12
  Fix: Move to environment variable

[LOW] Missing input validation
  File: src/handlers/user.py:28
  Fix: Validate user input before processing

Cost: $0.0850
```

### Option 2: Python

```python
from empathy_os.workflows import SecurityAuditWorkflow
import asyncio

async def audit():
    workflow = SecurityAuditWorkflow(enable_cache=True)
    result = await workflow.execute(target_path="./src")

    print(f"Status: {result.status}")
    print(f"Found {len(result.findings)} issues:")

    for finding in result.findings:
        print(f"  [{finding.severity}] {finding.description}")

    print(f"\nCost: ${result.cost_report.total_cost:.4f}")

asyncio.run(audit())
```

## Try More Workflows

Empathy Framework includes 10+ built-in workflows:

| Workflow | Command | What It Does |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Security Audit | `empathy workflow run security-audit` | Find vulnerabilities |
| Bug Prediction | `empathy workflow run bug-predict` | Predict likely bugs |
| Test Coverage | `empathy workflow run test-coverage` | Generate missing tests |
| Release Prep | `empathy workflow run release-prep` | Pre-release checklist |
| Dependency Check | `empathy workflow run dependency-check` | Find outdated deps |

```bash
# List all available workflows
empathy workflow list

# Get help for a specific workflow
empathy workflow run security-audit --help
```

---

## Understanding the Output

Every workflow returns:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `status` | `success`, `partial`, or `failed` |
| `findings` | List of issues found (for analysis workflows) |
| `cost_report` | API costs and cache hit rate |
| `metadata` | Timing, model used, etc. |

### Cost Tracking

```bash
# See your usage
empathy telemetry show

# See cost breakdown
empathy telemetry savings --days 7
```

All telemetry data stays local in `~/.empathy/telemetry/`.

## What Just Happened?

When you ran the security audit:

1. **File scanning** - The workflow read your source files
2. **Tiered analysis** - Simple files used a cheap model, complex ones used a capable model
3. **Pattern matching** - Known vulnerability patterns were detected
4. **Report generation** - Results were formatted and returned

This is the **tiered model** approach - automatically routing to the right model based on task complexity.
