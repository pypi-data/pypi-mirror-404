### 🚨 Breaking Changes

**Agent Coordination System Migration**

The legacy coordination system in `ShortTermMemory` has been removed in favor of the new, enhanced `CoordinationSignals` API. This migration provides better security, more features, and cleaner architecture.

**What Changed:**
- ❌ **Removed:** `ShortTermMemory.send_signal()` and `receive_signals()` methods
- ❌ **Removed:** `TTLStrategy.COORDINATION` constant
- ❌ **Changed:** Redis key format: `empathy:coord:*` → `empathy:signal:*`
- ✅ **New API:** `empathy_os.telemetry.CoordinationSignals` (Pattern 2 from Agent Coordination Architecture)

**Migration Guide:**

```python
# Before (v4.x - REMOVED):
from empathy_os.memory import ShortTermMemory, AgentCredentials

memory = ShortTermMemory()
credentials = AgentCredentials("agent-1", AccessTier.CONTRIBUTOR)
memory.send_signal("task_complete", {"status": "done"}, credentials, target_agent="agent-2")
signals = memory.receive_signals(credentials, signal_type="task_complete")

# After (v5.0 - NEW):
from empathy_os.telemetry import CoordinationSignals
from empathy_os.memory.types import AgentCredentials, AccessTier

coordinator = CoordinationSignals(agent_id="agent-1")
credentials = AgentCredentials("agent-1", AccessTier.CONTRIBUTOR)

# Send signal (with permission check)
coordinator.signal(
    signal_type="task_complete",
    target_agent="agent-2",
    payload={"status": "done"},
    credentials=credentials  # Required for security
)

# Receive signals
signals = coordinator.get_pending_signals(signal_type="task_complete")
```

**Benefits of Migration:**
- ✅ **Security:** Permission checks enforced (CONTRIBUTOR tier required)
- ✅ **Features:** Blocking wait with timeout, event streaming integration
- ✅ **Flexibility:** Per-signal TTL configuration (no fixed 5-minute limit)
- ✅ **Type Safety:** Structured `CoordinationSignal` dataclass with validation
- ✅ **Consistency:** Unified `empathy:` key namespace across framework

- Maintains consistency with other keys: `empathy:working:*`, `empathy:staged:*`, etc.

**Workflow Base Class Enhancements**

New opt-in features for workflows:

```python
workflow = MyWorkflow(
    enable_adaptive_routing=True,      # Pattern 3: Adaptive tier selection
    enable_heartbeat_tracking=True,    # Pattern 1: Agent liveness
    enable_coordination=True,          # Pattern 2: Inter-agent signals
    agent_id="my-workflow-abc123"      # Custom agent ID
)
```

### Fixed

  - `empathy meta-workflow ask "your request"` - Describe what you need
  - Auto-suggests appropriate agent teams based on intent
  - `--auto` flag for automatic execution of best match
  - Intent detection with confidence scoring

- **Intent detection system** (`intent_detector.py`)
  - Analyzes natural language requests
  - Maps to appropriate meta-workflow templates
  - Keyword and phrase pattern matching
  - Confidence scoring for match quality

- **Integrated skills**
  - Updated `/test` to suggest `/test-coverage` and `/test-maintenance`
  - Updated `/security-scan` to suggest `/release-prep`
  - Updated `/docs` to suggest `/manage-docs`

#### Built-in Templates & Infrastructure
- **Built-in meta-workflow templates** (`builtin_templates.py`)
  - `release-prep`: Comprehensive release readiness assessment
  - `test-coverage-boost`: Multi-agent test generation with gap analysis
  - `test-maintenance`: Automated test lifecycle management

  - `is_builtin()` method to identify built-in templates

- **Migration documentation**
  - `docs/CREWAI_MIGRATION.md`: Complete migration guide with examples
  - Before/after code comparisons
  - FAQ for common migration questions

### Architecture

**Execution Flow (Production Ready)**:
```text
User Request
    ↓
MetaOrchestrator (analyzes task complexity + domain)
    ↓
SocraticFormEngine (asks questions via AskUserQuestion callback)
    ↓
DynamicAgentCreator (generates agent team from responses)
    ↓
Real LLM Execution (Anthropic client with tier escalation)
    ↓
UsageTracker (telemetry + cost tracking)
    ↓
PatternLearner (stores in files + memory)
```

### Changed - DEPENDENCY OPTIMIZATION 📦

- **CrewAI moved to optional dependencies**
  - CrewAI and LangChain removed from core dependencies
  - Reduces install size and dependency conflicts
  - Install with `pip install empathy-framework[crewai]` if needed
  - The "Crew" workflows never actually used CrewAI library

- `SocraticFormEngine` now accepts `ask_user_callback` parameter for tool integration
- `MetaWorkflow._execute_at_tier()` now uses real LLM execution by default
- Added `_execute_llm_call()` method using Anthropic client
- `_simulate_llm_call()` retained as fallback for testing/no-API scenarios

### Deprecated

- **Crew-based workflows deprecated** in favor of meta-workflow system:
  - `ReleasePreparationCrew` → Use `empathy meta-workflow run release-prep`
  - `TestCoverageBoostCrew` → Use `empathy meta-workflow run test-coverage-boost`
  - `TestMaintenanceCrew` → Use `empathy meta-workflow run test-maintenance`
  - `ManageDocumentationCrew` → Use `empathy meta-workflow run manage-docs`
  - All deprecated workflows emit `DeprecationWarning` when instantiated
  - See [docs/CREWAI_MIGRATION.md](docs/CREWAI_MIGRATION.md) for migration guide

### Migration Notes

**From v4.2.1**: No breaking changes. Existing code continues to work:
- Tests using mock execution still work
- Form engine without callback uses defaults (backward compatible)
- Real execution only attempted when `mock_execution=False`
- Deprecated workflows continue to work

**To enable real execution**:
```python
# Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable
# Then use mock_execution=False
result = workflow.execute(mock_execution=False)
```

**To migrate from Crew workflows**:
```bash
# Instead of using ReleasePreparationCrew
empathy meta-workflow run release-prep

# Instead of using TestCoverageBoostCrew
empathy meta-workflow run test-coverage-boost
```

**Benefits of meta-workflows over Crew workflows**:
- Smaller dependency footprint (no CrewAI/LangChain required)
- Interactive configuration via Socratic questioning
- Automatic cost optimization with progressive tier escalation
- Session context for learning preferences
- 125+ tests covering the system

## [4.1.0] - 2026-01-17

### Added - MAJOR FEATURE 🚀

- **Progressive Tier Escalation System**: Intelligent cost optimization through automatic model tier progression
  - **Multi-tier execution**: Start with cheap models (gpt-4o-mini), escalate to capable (claude-3-5-sonnet) and premium (claude-opus-4) based on quality metrics
  - **Composite Quality Score (CQS)**: Multi-signal failure detection using test pass rate (40%), coverage (25%), assertion depth (20%), and LLM confidence (15%)
  - **Stagnation detection**: Automatic escalation when improvement plateaus (<5% gain for 2 consecutive runs)
  - **Partial escalation**: Only failed items escalate to next tier, optimizing costs
  - **Meta-orchestration**: Dynamic agent team creation (1 agent cheap, 2 capable, 3 premium) for specialized task handling
  - **Cost management**: Budget controls with approval prompts at $1 threshold, abort/warn modes
  - **Privacy-preserving telemetry**: Local JSONL tracking with SHA256-hashed user IDs, no PII
  - **Analytics & reporting**: Historical analysis of runs, escalation rates, cost savings (typically 70-85%)
  - **Retention policy**: Automatic cleanup of results older than N days (default: 30 days)
  - **CLI tools**: List, show, analytics, and cleanup commands for managing workflow results
  - **Files**: `src/empathy_os/workflows/progressive/` (7 new modules, 857 lines)

- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 123 tests for progressive workflows (86.58% coverage)
  - Core data structures and quality metrics (21 tests)
  - Escalation logic and orchestrator (18 tests)
  - Cost management and telemetry (33 tests)
  - Reporting and analytics (19 tests)

### Improved

- **Type hints**: Added return type annotations to telemetry and orchestrator modules
- **Test coverage**: Improved from 73.33% to 86.58% on progressive module through edge case tests
- **Code quality**: Fixed 8 failing tests in test_models_cli_comprehensive.py (WorkflowRunRecord parameter names)

### Performance

- **Cost optimization**: Progressive escalation saves 70-85% vs all-premium approach
- **Efficiency**: Cheap tier handles 70-80% of simple tasks without escalation
- **Smart routing**: Multi-signal failure analysis prevents unnecessary premium tier usage

### Tests

- ✅ **6,802+ tests passing** (143 skipped, 0 errors)
- ✅ **123 new progressive workflow tests** (100% pass rate)
- ✅ No regressions in existing functionality
- ✅ 86.58% coverage on progressive module

**Migration Guide**: Progressive workflows are opt-in. Existing workflows continue unchanged. To use:

```python
from empathy_os.workflows.progressive import ProgressiveTestGenWorkflow, EscalationConfig

config = EscalationConfig(enabled=True, max_cost=10.00)
workflow = ProgressiveTestGenWorkflow(config)
result = workflow.execute(target_file="path/to/file.py")
print(result.generate_report())
```

- **Comprehensive Test Suite** ([tests/unit/workflows/test_tier_fallback.py](tests/unit/workflows/test_tier_fallback.py))
  - 8 unit tests covering all fallback scenarios (100% passing)
  - 89% code coverage on tier_tracking module
  - 45% code coverage on base workflow tier fallback logic
  - Tests for: optimal path (CHEAP success), single/multiple tier upgrades, all tiers exhausted, exception handling, backward compatibility

### Changed

- **Health Check Workflow Quality Gate** ([src/empathy_os/workflows/health_check.py:156-187](src/empathy_os/workflows/health_check.py#L156-L187))
  - Default health score threshold changed from 100 to **95** (more practical balance)
  - Configurable via `--health-score-threshold` flag
  - Quality validation now blocks tier fallback if health score < threshold
  - Prevents unnecessary escalation to expensive tiers

- **Workflow Execution Strategy**
  - LLM-level fallback (ResilientExecutor) now disabled when tier fallback is enabled
  - Avoids double fallback (tier-level + model-level)
  - Clearer separation of concerns: tier fallback handles quality, model fallback handles API errors

### Technical Details

**Architecture:**
- Fallback chain: `ModelTier.CHEAP → ModelTier.CAPABLE → ModelTier.PREMIUM`
- Quality gates run after each stage execution
- Failed attempts logged with failure reason (e.g., `"health_score_low"`, `"validation_failed"`)
- Tier progression tracked: `workflow._tier_progression = [(stage, tier, success), ...]`
- Opt-in design: Default behavior unchanged for backward compatibility

**Cost Savings Examples:**
- Both stages succeed at CHEAP: **~90% savings** vs. all-PREMIUM
- 1 stage CAPABLE, 1 CHEAP: **~70% savings** vs. all-PREMIUM
- 1 stage PREMIUM, 1 CHEAP: **~50% savings** vs. all-PREMIUM

**Validation:**
- Production-ready with 8/8 tests passing
- Zero critical bugs
- Zero lint errors, zero type errors
- Comprehensive error handling with specific exceptions
- Full documentation: [TIER_FALLBACK_TEST_REPORT.md](TIER_FALLBACK_TEST_REPORT.md)

### Migration Guide

**No breaking changes.** Feature is opt-in and backward compatible.

**To enable tier fallback:**
```bash
# Standard mode (unchanged)
empathy workflow run health-check

# With tier fallback (new)
empathy workflow run health-check --use-recommended-tier

# Custom threshold
empathy workflow run health-check --use-recommended-tier --health-score-threshold 90
```

**Python API:**
```python
from empathy_os.workflows import get_workflow

workflow_cls = get_workflow("health-check")
workflow = workflow_cls(
    provider="anthropic",
    enable_tier_fallback=True,  # Enable feature
    health_score_threshold=95,  # Optional: customize threshold
)

result = await workflow.execute(path=".")

# Check tier progression
for stage, tier, success in workflow._tier_progression:
    print(f"{stage}: {tier} → {'✓' if success else '✗'}")
```

**When to use:**
- ✅ Cost-sensitive workflows where CHEAP tier often succeeds
- ✅ Workflows with clear quality metrics (health score, test coverage)
- ✅ Exploratory workflows where quality requirements vary
- ❌ Time-critical workflows (tier fallback adds latency on quality failures)
- ❌ Workflows where PREMIUM is always required

#### 📊 Transparent Cost Savings Analysis

**Tier Routing Savings: 34-86% depending on work role and task distribution**

##### Role-Based Savings (Measured)

Tier routing savings vary significantly based on your role and task complexity:

| Role | PREMIUM Usage | CAPABLE Usage | CHEAP Usage | Actual Savings |
|------|---------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| Architect / Designer | 60% | 30% | 10% | **34%** |
| Senior Developer | 25% | 50% | 25% | **65%** |
| Mid-Level Developer | 15% | 60% | 25% | **73%** |
| Junior Developer | 5% | 40% | 55% | **86%** |
| QA Engineer | 10% | 35% | 55% | **80%** |
| DevOps Engineer | 20% | 50% | 30% | **69%** |

**Key Insight**: The often-cited "80% savings" assumes balanced task distribution (12.5% PREMIUM, 37.5% CAPABLE, 50% CHEAP). Architects and senior developers performing design work will see lower savings due to higher PREMIUM tier usage.

##### Provider Comparison

**Pure Provider Stacks** (8-task workflow, balanced distribution):
- **Anthropic only** (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus): 79% savings
- **OpenAI only** (GPT-4o-mini/GPT-4o/o1): 81% savings
- **Hybrid routing** (mix providers): 87% savings

**Documentation**:
- [Role-Based Analysis](docs/cost-analysis/COST_SAVINGS_BY_ROLE_AND_PROVIDER.md) - Complete savings breakdown by role
- [Sensitivity Analysis](docs/cost-analysis/TIER_ROUTING_SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS.md) - How savings change with task distribution
- [Cost Breakdown](docs/COST_SAVINGS_BREAKDOWN.md) - All formulas and calculations

**Transparency**: All claims backed by pricing math (Anthropic/OpenAI published rates) and task distribution estimates. No real telemetry data yet - v3.8.1 will add usage tracking for personalized savings reports.

### Changed

#### BaseWorkflow Cache Support

- All 12 production workflows now support caching via `enable_cache=True` parameter
- Cache instance can be injected via constructor for shared cache across workflows
- Existing workflows work without modification (cache disabled by default)

### Performance

- **5μs** average cache lookup time (hash mode)
- **~100ms** for semantic similarity search (hybrid mode)
- **<1MB** memory overhead for typical usage (100 cached responses)
- **Disk storage** scales with usage (~10KB per cached response)

### Developer Experience

- **Zero-config** operation with sensible defaults
- **Optional dependencies** for hybrid cache (install with `[cache]` extra)
- **Interactive prompts** for ML dependency installation
- **Comprehensive logging** at DEBUG level for troubleshooting

## [1.8.0-alpha] - 2025-11-24

### Added - Claude Memory Integration

**Core Memory System**
- **ClaudeMemoryLoader**: Complete CLAUDE.md file reader with hierarchical memory loading
  - Enterprise-level memory: `/etc/claude/CLAUDE.md` or `CLAUDE_ENTERPRISE_MEMORY` env var
  - User-level memory: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (personal preferences)
  - Project-level memory: `./.claude/CLAUDE.md` (team/project specific)
  - Loads in hierarchical order (Enterprise → User → Project) with clear precedence
  - Caching system for performance optimization
  - File size limits (1MB default) and validation

**@import Directive Support**
- Modular memory organization with `@path/to/file.md` syntax
- Circular import detection (prevents infinite loops)
- Import depth limiting (5 levels default, configurable)
- Relative path resolution from base directory
- Recursive import processing with proper error handling

**EmpathyLLM Integration**
- `ClaudeMemoryConfig`: Comprehensive configuration for memory integration
  - Enable/disable memory loading per level (enterprise/user/project)
  - Configurable depth limits and file size restrictions
  - Optional file validation
- Memory prepended to all LLM system prompts across all 5 empathy levels
- `reload_memory()` method for runtime memory updates without restart
- `_build_system_prompt()`: Combines memory with level-specific instructions
- Memory affects behavior of all interactions (Reactive → Systems levels)

**Documentation & Examples**
- **examples/claude_memory/user-CLAUDE.md**: Example user-level memory file
  - Communication preferences, coding standards, work context
  - Demonstrates personal preference storage
- **examples/claude_memory/project-CLAUDE.md**: Example project-level memory file
  - Project context, architecture patterns, security requirements
  - Empathy Framework-specific guidelines and standards
- **examples/claude_memory/example-with-imports.md**: Import directive demo
  - Shows modular memory organization patterns

**Comprehensive Testing**
- **tests/test_claude_memory.py**: 15+ test cases covering all features
  - Config defaults and customization tests
  - Hierarchical memory loading (enterprise/user/project)
  - @import directive processing and recursion
  - Circular import detection
  - Depth limit enforcement
  - File size validation
  - Cache management (clear/reload)
  - Integration with EmpathyLLM
  - Memory reloading after file changes
- All tests passing with proper fixtures and mocking

### Changed

**Core Architecture**
- **empathy_llm_toolkit/core.py**: Enhanced EmpathyLLM with memory support
  - Added `claude_memory_config` and `project_root` parameters
  - Added `_cached_memory` for performance optimization
  - All 5 empathy level handlers now use `_build_system_prompt()` for consistent memory integration
  - Memory loaded once at initialization, cached for all subsequent interactions

**Dependencies**
- Added structlog for structured logging in memory module
- No new external dependencies required (uses existing framework libs)

### Technical Details

**Memory Loading Flow**
1. Initialize `EmpathyLLM` with `claude_memory_config` and `project_root`
2. `ClaudeMemoryLoader` loads files in hierarchical order
3. Each file processed for @import directives (recursive, depth-limited)
4. Combined memory cached in `_cached_memory` attribute
5. Every LLM call prepends memory to system prompt
6. Memory affects all 5 empathy levels uniformly

**File Locations**
- Enterprise: `/etc/claude/CLAUDE.md` or env var `CLAUDE_ENTERPRISE_MEMORY`
- User: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Project: `./.claude/CLAUDE.md` (preferred) or `./CLAUDE.md` (fallback)

**Safety Features**
- Circular import detection (prevents infinite loops)
- Depth limiting (default 5 levels, prevents excessive nesting)
- File size limits (default 1MB, prevents memory issues)
- Import stack tracking for cycle detection
- Graceful degradation (returns empty string on errors if validation disabled)

### Enterprise Privacy Foundation

This release is Phase 1 of the enterprise privacy integration roadmap:
- ✅ **Phase 1 (v1.8.0-alpha)**: Claude Memory Integration - COMPLETE
- ⏳ **Phase 2 (v1.8.0-beta)**: PII scrubbing, audit logging, EnterprisePrivacyConfig
- ⏳ **Phase 3 (v1.8.0)**: VSCode privacy UI, documentation
- ⏳ **Future**: Full MemDocs integration with 3-tier privacy system

**Privacy Goals**
- Give enterprise developers control over memory scope (enterprise/user/project)
- Enable local-only memory (no cloud storage of sensitive instructions)
- Foundation for air-gapped/hybrid/full-integration deployment models
- Compliance-ready architecture (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2)

### Quality Metrics
- **New Module**: empathy_llm_toolkit/claude_memory.py (483 lines)
- **Modified Core**: empathy_llm_toolkit/core.py (memory integration)
- **Tests Added**: 15+ comprehensive test cases
- **Test Coverage**: All memory features covered
- **Example Files**: 3 sample CLAUDE.md files
- **Documentation**: Inline docstrings with Google style

### Breaking Changes
None - this is an additive feature. Memory integration is opt-in via `claude_memory_config`.

### Upgrade Notes
- To use Claude memory: Pass `ClaudeMemoryConfig(enabled=True)` to `EmpathyLLM.__init__()`
- Create `.claude/CLAUDE.md` in your project root with instructions
- See examples/claude_memory/ for sample memory files
- Memory is disabled by default (backward compatible)
