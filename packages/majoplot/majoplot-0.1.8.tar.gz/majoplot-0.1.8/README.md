# majoplot

**Majoplot** is designed to automate repetitive data-processing tasks commonly encountered in **condensed-matter physics laboratories**.
Since figures generated by **Origin** can retain embedded data when pasted into PowerPoint slides—making it a convenient tool for data presentation—Majoplot uses **OriginLab as its primary plotting backend**.

## Main Features

* Preview raw data generated by instruments such as **VSM, PPMS, and XRD** within a single interface
* Batch-generate figures and automatically organize them into appropriate **Folders** inside an **OPJU project**

## Notes

This program **does not include OriginLab**.
To use OriginLab as the plotting backend, you must **obtain a valid OriginLab license** and **install OriginLab on your system** separately.

## Installation

Make sure **Python (including pip)** is installed on your system.

```bash
# (Not recommended) Install globally via pip
# pip install majoplot

# (Recommended) Install via uv
uv tool install majoplot
## If the uv tool script directory is not in your PATH, run:
## python -m uv tool install majoplot
```

## Usage

1. Open a command-line window in any directory and run the following command to launch the graphical interface:

```bash
# If installed globally via pip
# python -m majoplot

# If installed via uv
uv run majoplot
## If the uv tool script directory is not in PATH, run:
## python -m uv run majoplot
```

Then simply follow the instructions provided by the graphical user interface.
