A template repository for GitHub projects using Python and uv.

## Makefile

The project relies heavily on `make`, which is used to run *all* commands. It has been tested on macOS and Ubuntu 22.04. Windows users need to install [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

Run `make` to see the list of the available targets.

```console
$ make [help]

## Installation

This is a template repository, so first, create a new GitHub repository and choose this as its template. Then, follow the installation steps below.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/<your-github-name>/<your-project-name>.git `
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd <your-project-name>`
3. Check the status of the dev environment: `make info` will list the tools currently installed and the default value of project vars, as in the example below:

        pyrays v0.1.0

        System:
          OS: Darwin
          Shell: /bin/bash - GNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (arm64-apple-darwin24)
          Make: GNU Make 3.81
          Git: git version 2.39.5 (Apple Git-154)
        Project:
          Project name: pyrays
          Project description: 'A GitHub template for Python projects using uv'
          Project author: Fabio Calefato (bateman <fcalefato@gmail.com>)
          Project version: 0.1.0
          Project license: MIT
          Project repository: https://github.com/bateman/PyRays
          Project directory: /Users/fabio/Dev/git/PyRays
        Python:
          Python version: 3.12.9
          Virtualenv name: .venv
          uv version: uv 0.6.2 (6d3614eec 2025-02-19)
        Docker:
          Docker: Docker version 27.5.1, build 9f9e405
          Docker Compose: Docker Compose version v2.32.4-desktop.1
          Docker image name: pyrays
          Docker container name: pyrays

4. If any needed tools are missing, they will be marked as '*not installed*'. Install them and re-run `make info` to ensure the tools are now correctly installed and in your PATH.
5. Update the project variables values by editing `pyproject.toml`. In addition, you can add any of the variables in the list below to a `Makefile.env` file to override the default values used in the  `Makefile`. You can check the configuration of each variable using `make info`.

        PYTHON_VERSION=3.12.9
        DOCKER_CONTAINER_NAME=pyrays
        DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME=pyrays
        DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG=latest

6. To create the virtual environment, run `make virtualenv`. Note that this will also check for the requested Python version; if not available, it will automatically install it using `uv`.
7. To complete the installation for development purposes, run `make install` -- this will install all development dependencies. Otherwise, for production purposes only, run `make production`.

> [!NOTE]
> All Make targets use `uv run` to automatically execute commands within the virtual environment, so manual activation (via `source .venv/bin/activate`) is optional. Manual activation is only needed for interactive work like running a Python REPL or when you want persistent environment activation across multiple manual commands.

> [!TIP]
> The installation step will install some 'default' dependencies, such as `rich` and `pretty-errors`, but also dev-dependecies, such as `ruff` and `pytest`.
> Edit the `pyproject.toml` to add/remove dependencies before running `make install`. Otherwise, you can add and remove dependencies later using `uv add` and `uv remove` commands.

> [!NOTE]
> The `name` field in `pyproject.toml` will be converted to lowercase and whitespaces will be replaced by `_`. This value will be the name of your project module.

> [!CAUTION]
> The `Makefile.env` should specify at least the `PYTHON_VERSION=...`. Otherwise, the GitHub Actions will fail. Also, make sure that the Python version specified in `Makefile.env` (e.g., 3.12.9) satisfies the requirements in `pyproject.toml` file (e.g., requires-python = ">=3.12").

## Development

The project uses the following development libraries:

* `ruff`: for code linting, formatting, and security analysis.
* `mypy`: for static type-checking.
* `pre-commit`: for automating all the checks above before committing.

> [!NOTE]
> Pre-commit hooks are automatically installed when you run `make install`. The hooks will run automatically before each commit to ensure code quality.
>
> If you need to reinstall hooks (e.g., after updating `.pre-commit-config.yaml` or if hooks were uninstalled), run:
> ```bash
> make install-hooks
> ```

> [!TIP]
> To manually run code formatting and linting, run `make format` and `make lint`, respectively.
> To execute all the checks, stage your changes, then run `make precommit`.

## Execution

* To run the project: `make run`

> [!TIP]
> Pass parameters using the ARGS variable (e.g., `make run ARGS="--text Ciao --color red"`).

## Testing

* To run the tests: `make test`

> [!TIP]
> Pass parameters using the ARGS variable (e.g., `make test ARGS="--cov-report=xml"`).

> [!NOTE]
> Tests are executed using `pytest`. Test coverage is calculated using the plugin `pytest-cov`.

> [!WARNING]
> Pushing new commits to GitHub, will trigger the GitHub Action defined in `tests.yml`, which will upload the coverage report to [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/). To ensure correct execution, first log in to Codecov and enable the coverage report for your repository; this will generate a `CODECOV_TOKEN`. Then, add the `CODECOV_TOKEN` to your repository's 'Actions secrets and variables' settings page.

## Update

Run `make update` to update all the dependencies using `uv`.

## Build

Run `make build` to build the project as a Python package.
The `*.tar.gz` and `*.whl` will be placed in the `BUILD` directory (by default `dist`).

> [!TIP]
> Run `make build-all` to build both the project's wheel and tarball, as well as the documentation site.

## Release

* Run `make tag ARGS="<semvertag>"` to bump the version of the project and write the new version back to `pyproject.toml`, where `<semvertag>` is one of the following rules: `patch`, `minor`, `major`, `prepatch`, `preminor`, `premajor`, `prerelease`.

  The table below illustrates the effect of these rules with concrete examples.

  | **Rule**     | **Before** | **After** |
  |--------------|-----------:|----------:|
  | `major`      |    1.3.0   |   2.0.0   |
  | `minor`      |    2.1.4   |   2.2.0   |
  | `patch`      |    4.1.1   |   4.1.2   |
  | `premajor`   |    1.0.2   |  2.0.0a0  |
  | `preminor`   |    1.0.2   |  1.1.0a0  |
  | `prepatch`   |    1.0.2   |  1.0.3a0  |
  | `prerelease` |    1.0.2   |  1.0.3a0  |
  | `prerelease` |   1.0.3a0  |  1.0.3a1  |
  | `prerelease` |   1.0.3b0  |  1.0.3b1  |

* Run `make release` to:
1. Push the tagged version to the origin repository
2. Trigger two GitHub Actions workflows:
   - `release.yml`: Creates and uploads a new release to GitHub
   - `docker.yml`: Builds and pushes a new Docker image to DockerHub

   The specific workflows are detailed in the GitHub Actions section below.

> [!NOTE]
> Release notes are automatically generated by the `release.yml` workflow when you push a tag. The release notes include all commits since the previous tag, formatted as a list with commit messages and short hashes. You don't need to manually create or maintain a CHANGELOG.md file.

## GitHub Actions

As shown in the table below, there are five GitHub Actions workflows. Take note on the event triggering the run and the Secrets needed for a successful execution.

| **Action name**        | **Purpose**                                 | **Runs on**                                            | **Secrets**                             |
|:----------------------:|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
|  `release.yml`         | Release package to PyPI and GitHub 📦       | tag push                                               | -                                       |
|   `docker.yml`         | Push image to DockerHub 🚀                  | tag push, manual                                       | `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`, `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` |
|   `tests.yml`          | Run tests and upload coverage to Codecov 📊 | commit push on branches != `main`, manual              | `CODECOV_TOKEN`                         |
|    `docs.yml`          | Upload documentation to GitHub Pages 📓     | commit push on `docs/**` path of `main` branch, tag push, manual | -                                       |
| `testpypi-release.yml` | Manually publish package to TestPyPI 📦     | manual                                                 | -                                       |

> [!CAUTION]
> Follow this [guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/publishing-package-distribution-releases-using-github-actions-ci-cd-workflows/#configuring-trusted-publishing) and configure PyPI’s trusted publishing implementation to connect to GitHub Actions CI/CD. Otherwise, the release workflow will fail.

## Publish to PyPI

To manually publish your package to PyPI, run `make publish`. If necessary, this will build the project as a Python package and upload the generated `*.tar.gz` and `*.whl` files to PyPI.

> [!TIP]
> Run `make publish-all` to manually publish the package to PyPI and the documentation site to GitHub Pages.

> [!WARNING]
> Before trying to manually publish your package to PyPI, make sure you have a valid API token. Then, you need to create a `.env' file formatted as follows:
> ```
> UV_PUBLISH_PASSWORD=<your-PyPI-token-here>
> UV_PUBLISH_USERNAME=__token__
> ```

> [!TIP]
> I recommend installing `autoenv` via [homebrew](https://brew.sh) to automatically load the environment variables whenever you cd into the project directory.

## Documentation

* Run `make docs-build` to build the project documentation using `mkdocs`. The documentation will be generated from your project files' comments in docstring format, thanks to the `mkdocstrings` plugin.
The documentation files will be stored in the `DOCS_SITE` directory (by default `site`).
* Run `make docs-serve` to browse the built site locally, at http://127.0.0.1:8000/your-github-name/your-project-name/
* Run `make docs-publish` to publish the documentation site as GitHub pages. The content will be published to a separate branch, named `gh-pages`. Access the documentation online at https://your-github-name.github.io/your-project-name/

> [!TIP]
> You can edit the `mkdocs.yml` file to adapt it to your project's specifics. For example, you can change the `material` theme or adjust the logo and colors. Refer to this [guide](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/) for more.

> [!NOTE]
> After the first deployment to your GitHub repository, your repository Pages settings (Settings > Pages) will be automatically updated to point to the documentation site content stored in the `gh-pages` branch. The `docs.yml` workflow uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` with automatic permissions, so no additional secrets are required.

## Docker

* To build the Docker container: `make docker-build`
* To start the Docker container and run the application: `make docker-run`
* To build and run: `make docker-all`

> [!TIP]
> You can override Docker variables directly from the command line without editing `Makefile.env`. For example:
> ```bash
> make docker-build DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG=dev
> make docker-run DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG=v1.0.0
> make docker-all DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME=myapp DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG=staging
> ```
> This is useful for CI/CD pipelines or when you need to quickly test different configurations.

> [!NOTE]
> Before building the container, you can edit `Makefile.env` and change the name of the image and or container (by default they will match the name of your project).

> [!WARNING]
> Pushing a new tag to GitHub will trigger the GitHub Action defined in `docker.yml`. To ensure correct execution, you first need to add the `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` secrets to your repository's 'Actions secrets and variables' settings page.
