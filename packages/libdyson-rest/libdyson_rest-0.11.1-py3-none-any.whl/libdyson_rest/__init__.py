"""
libdyson-rest: Python library for interacting with the Dyson REST API.

This library provides a clean interface for communicating with Dyson devices
through their official REST API endpoints as documented in the OpenAPI specification.

Key Features:
- Full OpenAPI specification compliance
- Two-step authentication with OTP codes
- Complete device management and IoT credentials
- Type-safe data models
- Comprehensive error handling
- Context manager support
- Both synchronous and asynchronous client support

Basic Usage (Synchronous):
    from libdyson_rest import DysonClient

    client = DysonClient(email="your@email.com", password="password")

    # Two-step authentication
    challenge = client.begin_login()
    # Check email for OTP code
    login_info = client.complete_login(str(challenge.challenge_id), "123456")

    # Get devices
    devices = client.get_devices()
    for device in devices:
        print(f"Device: {device.name} ({device.serial_number})")

Basic Usage (Asynchronous):
    from libdyson_rest import AsyncDysonClient

    async def main():
        async with AsyncDysonClient(
            email="your@email.com", password="password"
        ) as client:
            # Two-step authentication
            challenge = await client.begin_login()
            # Check email for OTP code
            login_info = await client.complete_login(
                str(challenge.challenge_id), "123456"
            )

            # Get devices
            devices = await client.get_devices()
            for device in devices:
                print(f"Device: {device.name} ({device.serial_number})")
