# Writing Style Guidelines

Write in simple English. Like talking to a friend who is not a native speaker.

## Banned Words

Do not use these words. They sound too much like AI:

- comprehensive
- practical
- robust
- leverage
- utilize (say "use")
- streamline
- seamless
- cutting-edge
- state-of-the-art
- game-changer
- synergy
- holistic
- paradigm
- empower
- innovative
- revolutionary
- best-in-class
- world-class
- next-generation
- scalable (only if talking about tech)
- ecosystem (only if talking about nature)
- delve
- dive deep
- unpack
- at the end of the day
- moving forward
- circle back
- touch base

## How to Write

1. Short sentences are better
2. Use easy words
3. No business talk
4. Sound like a person, not a robot
5. If there is a simpler word, use it
6. Do not add extra words that mean nothing
