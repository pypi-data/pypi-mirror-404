# cc-dump Roadmap

## Completed

### Sprint 1
- **Virtual rendering for conversation panel** — Line API architecture with O(log n) turn lookup and O(viewport) rendering.

### Sprint 3
- **Front-ellipsed filenames for Read tool** — Long file paths display with leading ellipsis for cleaner UI.
- **Show skill name for Skill tool** — Skill name displayed prominently when invoked.
- **Show bash command and args for Bash tool** — Command name and first few arguments shown in concise summary.

### Sprint 4
- **Tool use / tool result color correlation** — Consistent color coding links tool_use blocks with their corresponding tool_result blocks.
- **Meaningful collapsed tool result summaries** — Collapsed tool results show tool name and key result info instead of hiding content.

### Sprint 5
- **HTTP headers display** — Headers feature shows HTTP headers from intercepted requests.
