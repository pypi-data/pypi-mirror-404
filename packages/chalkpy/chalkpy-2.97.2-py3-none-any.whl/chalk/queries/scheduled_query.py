        """Create an offline query which runs on a schedule.

        Scheduled queries do not produce datasets, but persist their results in the
        online and/or offline feature stores.

        By default, scheduled queries use incrementalization to only ingest data that
        has been updated since the last run.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name
            A unique name for the scheduled query. The name of the scheduled query
            will show up in the dashboard and will be uset to set the incremetalization
            metadata.
        schedule
            A cron schedule or a `Duration` object representing the interval at which
            the query should run.
        output
            The features that this query will compute. Namespaces are exploded into all
            features in the namespace.
        recompute_features
            Whether to recompute all features or load from the feature store.
            If `True`, all features will be recomputed.
            If `False`, all features will be loaded from the feature store.
            If a list of features, only those features will be recomputed, and the rest
            will be loaded from the feature store.
        max_samples
            The maximum number of samples to compute.
        lower_bound
            A hard-coded lower bound for the query. If set, the query will not use
            incrementalization.
        upper_bound
            A hard-coded upper bound for the query. If set, the query will not use
            incrementalization.
        tags
            Allows selecting resolvers with these tags.
        dataset_name
            Associated dataset name for the scheduled query.
        required_resolver_tags
            Requires that resolvers have these tags.
        store_online
            Whether to store the results of this query in the online store.
        store_offline
            Whether to store the results of this query in the offline store.
        incremental_resolvers
            If set to None, Chalk will incrementalize resolvers in the query's root namespaces.
            If set to a list of resolvers, this set will be used for incrementalization.
            Incremental resolvers must return a feature time in its output, and must return a `DataFrame`.
            Most commonly, this will be the name of a SQL file resolver. Chalk will ingest all new data
            from these resolvers and propagate changes to values in the root namespace.
        planner_options
            A dictionary of options to pass to the planner. These are typically provided by Chalk Support
            for specific use cases.
        resource_group
            The resource group to use for the query. If not set, the default resource group will be used.


        Returns
        -------
        ScheduledQuery
            A scheduled query object.

        Examples
