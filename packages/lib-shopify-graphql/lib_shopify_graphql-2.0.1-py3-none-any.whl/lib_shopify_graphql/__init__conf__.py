"""Static package metadata surfaced to CLI commands and documentation.

Purpose
-------
Expose the current project metadata as simple constants. These values are kept
in sync with ``pyproject.toml`` by development automation (tests, push
pipelines), so runtime code does not query packaging metadata.

Contents
--------
* Module-level constants describing the published package.
* :func:`print_info` rendering the constants for the CLI ``info`` command.

System Role
-----------
Lives in the adapters/platform layer; CLI transports import these constants to
present authoritative project information without invoking packaging APIs.

    Why
        Provides a single, auditable rendering function so documentation and

        Writes to ``stdout``.
