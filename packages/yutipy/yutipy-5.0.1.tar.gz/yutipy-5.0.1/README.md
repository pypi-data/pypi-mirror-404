## Features

- Simple & Easy integration with popular music APIs.
- Search for music by artist and song title across multiple platforms.
- Authorize and access user resources easily.

### Available Music Platforms

Right now, the following music platforms are available in yutipy for searching music. New platforms will be added in the future.
Feel free to request any music platform you would like me to add by opening an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/CheapNightbot/yutipy/issues) or by emailing me.

- `Deezer`: https://www.deezer.com
- `iTunes`: https://music.apple.com
- `KKBOX`: https://www.kkbox.com
- `Lastfm`: https://last.fm
- `Spotify`: https://spotify.com
- `YouTube Music`: https://music.youtube.com

## Installation

You can install the package using pip. Make sure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed.

```bash
pip install -U yutipy
```

## Usage Example

Here's a quick example of how to use the `yutipy` package to search for a song on **Deezer**:

```python
from yutipy.deezer import Deezer

with Deezer() as deezer:
    result = deezer.search("Artist Name", "Song Title")
    print(result)
```

For more usage examples, see the [Usage Examples](https://yutipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage_examples.html) page in docs.

## Command-Line Interface (CLI)

The `yutipy` package includes a CLI tool that allows you to search for music directly from the command line and configure API keys interactively.

### Search for Music

You can use the CLI tool to search for music across multiple platforms:

```bash
yutipy-cli "Rick Astley" "Never Gonna Give You Up" --service spotify
```

#### Options:
- `artist` (required): The name of the artist.
- `song` (required): The title of the song.
- `--service` (required): Specify a single service to search (e.g., `deezer`, `spotify`, `itunes`).
- `--limit`: The number of results to retrieve (default: 5).
- `--verbose`: Enable logging in the terminal.
- `--version`: Show installed yutipy version and exit.

### Configuration Wizard

To set up your API keys interactively, use the configuration wizard:

```bash
yutipy-config
```

The wizard will guide you through obtaining and setting up API keys for supported services like Spotify and KKBOX. If the required environment variables are already set, the wizard will skip those steps.
