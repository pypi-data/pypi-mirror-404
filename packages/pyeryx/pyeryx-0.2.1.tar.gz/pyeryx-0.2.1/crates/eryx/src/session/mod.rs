//! Session-based execution for persistent WASM state.
//!
//! This module provides session-based execution that maintains state between
//! WASM executions, avoiding the ~1.5ms Python interpreter initialization
//! overhead on each call.
//!
//! ## Available Session Types
//!
//! - **[`SessionExecutor`]**: Core executor that keeps WASM Store and Instance alive
//!   between executions. This is the foundation for session-based execution.
//!
//! - **[`InProcessSession`]**: High-level session API wrapping the sandbox.
//!   Provides a simple interface for REPL-style interactive execution.
//!
//! ## State Persistence (Coming Soon)
//!
//! The WIT export approach will enable Python-level state snapshots via
//! `snapshot_state()` and `restore_state()` exports in the runtime. This
//! provides serializable state with minimal overhead (~KB vs ~50MB for
//! WASM-level snapshots).
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use eryx::session::{InProcessSession, Session};
//!
//! // Create a sandbox and start a session
//! let sandbox = Sandbox::builder()
//!     .with_embedded_runtime()
//!     .build()?;
//!
//! let mut session = InProcessSession::new(&sandbox).await?;
//!
//! // Execute multiple statements, preserving state
//! session.execute("x = 1").await?;
//! session.execute("y = 2").await?;
//! let result = session.execute("print(x + y)").await?;
//! assert_eq!(result.stdout, "3");
//!
//! // Reset to fresh state
//! session.reset().await?;
//! ```

/// Trait for sessions that support state snapshots.
///
/// Snapshots capture the current state of the session so it can be:
/// - Persisted to disk or a database
/// - Sent over the network to another process
/// - Restored later to continue execution
///
/// # Snapshot Timing
///
/// Snapshots can only be captured when `execute()` has returned. It is not
/// possible to snapshot mid-execution (e.g., while Python code is running).
/// This is a fundamental limitation of JIT-compiled WASM.
///
/// # Implementation Note
///
/// The recommended approach for snapshots is the WIT export method, where
/// Python-level state is serialized via `pickle` and exposed through
/// `snapshot_state()` and `restore_state()` exports in the runtime.
