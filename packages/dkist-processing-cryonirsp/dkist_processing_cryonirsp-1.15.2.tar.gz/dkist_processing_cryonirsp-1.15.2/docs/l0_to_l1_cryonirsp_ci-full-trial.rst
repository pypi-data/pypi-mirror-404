l0_to_l1_cryonirsp_ci-full-trial
================================

This trial workflow is designed for pipeline testing internal to the DKIST Data Center (DC). It runs the full science
pipeline, but stops short of publishing the results or activating downstream DC services. The pipeline products
are transferred to an internal location where they can be examined by DC personnel or DKIST scientists.
