# HOW THIS ALL WORKS #
######################
#
# By analogy
#
# Something to know: Spruce, Pine, and Fir all have pretty similar physical properties (like density). This is why
# framing lumber is often sold as "SPF"; it could be any of these three woods because they're similar enough for
# building.
#
# Now, the analogy of how we sort and figure out how many map scans and scan steps there are...
#
# We will be sorting wooden blocks. These blocks have 2 characteristics that we can directly observe: shape and color.
# We know that the factory only makes two shapes of blocks: spheres and cubes.
# We know that the factory only uses three colors: red, green, and blue.
# The blocks can be made of different woods: spruce, pine, or fir. Unfortunately we *can't* tell which wood is which
# via direct observation (especially after they have been painted).
# Additionally, the factory stamps a serial number on every block. These numbers are continuously increasing and never
# repeat.
#
# The problem is that we need to sort blocks based on the type of wood used.
#
# Fortunately we know how the factory makes these blocks:
#
# o They make exactly 6 blocks (2 shapes * 3 colors) from each board of wood
# o They use exactly 3 boards of wood each day (it's not a very big factory)
# o They *always* start with a board of spruce, then a board of pine, and finally a board of fir
# o When processing a single board, the sequence is:
#   1. Make 3 spheres
#   2. Color a sphere red. This block is done so stamp it with a serial number.
#   3. Color a sphere blue. This block is done so stamp it with a serial number.
#   4. Color the last sphere green. This block is done so stamp it with a serial number.
#   5. Repeat steps 1-4 but with cubes instead of spheres.
#
# With all of this information we can easily sort the blocks by wood type. The algorithm works like this.
#
# 1. Choose a (shape, color) combination. For this example we'll use green spheres
# 2. Collect all green spheres
# 3. Sort the green spheres by their serial numbers. They won't be in sequence, but that doesn't matter.
# 4. The lowest serial number came from the first board of the day (spruce), the middle number comes from the second
#    (pine) board, and the largest number comes from the last (fir) board.
# 5. Start a new set of piles for spruce, pine, and fir, and place the sorted green spheres into these piles.
# 6. Repeat steps 1-5 for all other (shape, color) combinations.
#
# And there you go! We now have correctly sorted the blocks by type of wood.
# We have used our knowledge of the GENERATING PROCESS and OBSERVABLE PROPERTIES to sort by an UNOBSERVABLE PROPERTY.
#
# Analogy over.
#
# We want to sort frames by map_scan. This is the UNOBSERVABLE PROPERTY (like wood type).
# Each frame has many OBSERVABLE PROPERTIES (like color, shape, and serial #). In reality, we have 5 such properties:
#  1. Current scan step
#  2. Current measurement
#  3. Current modstate
#  4. Current sub repeat
#  5. Obs time
#
# Obs time is monotonically increasing and never repeats. It is the serial number in the analogy.
#
# A single frame gets ingested into a `SingleScanStep`. This is just a convenience container for the OBSERVABLE
# PROPERTIES we care about. A `SingleScanStep` is like a single block in the analogy.
#
# `MapScanStepStemBase.scan_step_dict` is how we sort frames based on their OBSERVABLE PROPERTIES. Instead of a pile
# of green spheres imagine a bag labeled "spheres" containing 3 sub-bags, each labeled by color. Each bag in that
# analogy is a level of the `scan_step_dict` dictionary; one for each of the OBSERVABLE PROPERTIES.
# If we go to the innermost level of that dictionary we will find a list of `SingleScanStep` objects. This is like
# going into the "sphere" bag, then the "green" bag and finding 3 blocks (for the three different woods)*.
#
# The number of `SingleScanStep` objects at the innermost level of `scan_step_dict` is the number of map scans.
#
# We can also use the `scan_step_dict` to figure out which map scan a frame comes from. This is what
# `MapScanStepStemBase.get_map_scan_for_key()` does. It sorts the innermost list by obs time and then figures out
# where in the resulting order the current frame belongs.
#
# Finally, once we can segregate frames (i.e., `SingleScanStep` objects) by map scan, we are able to figure out
# the number of scan steps in each map scan. This is what the methods in `NumberOfScanStepsBud` do and they allow us
# to account for aborts.
# Back to the analogy, we don't want different numbers of, e.g., green spheres and red cubes. If the factory stops after
# processing at least one full board (map scan) then we only accept blocks that come from complete boards because we
# have at least one full set of (color, shape) blocks. If, however, the factory aborts during the first board then we
# will be OK with a complete set of blocks of the same shape (scan step). So if the factory stops while making the
# green cube then we'll just take all the spheres throw away all the cubes.
#
#########
#
# Hopefully this helps you understand how we are able to sort by map scan even though there is no header key for it.
# We use our knowledge the loops that produce the data (GENERATING PROCESS) and the header values for scan step,
# measurement, modstate, sub repeat, and obs time (OBSERVABLE PROPERTIES) to infer the map scan (UNOBSERVABLE PROPERTY).
#
#
# *(We actually could make just single flat "piles" of blocks instead of nested bags/dictionaries. This would mean using
#   keys like `f"{obj.scan_step}_{obj.measurement}_{obj.modstate}_{obj.sub_repeat}"`, which is pretty weird from a
#   coding perspective).
