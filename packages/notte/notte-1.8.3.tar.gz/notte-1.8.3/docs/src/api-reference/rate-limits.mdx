description: API rate limiting and response headers
---

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and platform stability.

## Rate limit headers

Every response includes headers with your current rate limit status:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum requests allowed per window |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests remaining in current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix timestamp when the window resets |

## Rate limit exceeded (429)

```json
{
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "detail": "Please wait before making more requests"
}
```

## Checking your limits

```bash
curl -I https://api.notte.cc/health \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NOTTE_API_KEY"
```

Response headers:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1704067200
```
