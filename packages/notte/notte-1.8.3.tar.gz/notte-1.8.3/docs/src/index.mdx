---

You're at the best place to automate your browser. Notte is a unified platform to build, run, and deploy AI agents and web automation scripts. Browser infrastructure, agents framework, serverless functions, and observability, all in one single place.

## Overview

The **Platform** API services provides the infrastructure and the primitives to run your automations — browser sessions, web agents framework, serverless functions, and scraping APIs. This documentation covers the technical reference for the Platform.

The **Products** help you build faster. Create automation scripts with our AI assistant, teach by workflow demonstration (screen recording), orcode in our automation studio. See the product guides below or jump straight into the [Console](https://console.notte.cc) to get started.
