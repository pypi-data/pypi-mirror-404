File storage allows agents to upload and download files from websites. Storage is persistent and session-scoped so you can retrieve files after the session ends.

```python
from notte_sdk import NotteClient

client = NotteClient()
storage = client.FileStorage()

# Upload files before the session
storage.upload("document.pdf")

# Attach storage to session
with client.Session(storage=storage) as session:
    agent = client.Agent(session=session)
    agent.run(task="Upload document.pdf and download the receipt")

# Download files after the session
for file_name in storage.list_downloaded_files():
    storage.download(file_name=file_name, local_dir="./downloads")
```
