description: Handle rate limits in the Notte SDK
---

When you exceed rate limits, the API returns a `429` status code. Implement backoff to handle this gracefully.

## Exponential backoff

```python
import time
from notte_sdk import NotteClient
from notte_sdk.errors import NotteAPIError

client = NotteClient()

def request_with_backoff(max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            with client.Session() as session:
                return session.scrape(url="https://example.com")
        except NotteAPIError as e:
            if e.status_code == 429:
                wait_time = 2 ** attempt  # 1, 2, 4 seconds
                print(f"Rate limited. Waiting {wait_time}s...")
                time.sleep(wait_time)
            else:
                raise
    raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
```

## Best practices

1. **Implement backoff** — Always handle 429 responses with exponential backoff
2. **Batch requests** — Combine multiple operations when possible
3. **Cache responses** — Avoid redundant API calls by caching results
