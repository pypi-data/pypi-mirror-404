Browser Agents are AI-powered systems that can autonomously navigate websites, complete tasks, and extract information using natural language instructions.

## What is a Browser Agent?

A Browser Agent combines:
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for reasoning and decision-making
- **Browser Sessions** for executing actions
- **Vision capabilities** to understand web pages
- **Autonomous planning** to complete multi-step tasks

Unlike scripted automation, agents can adapt to changes, handle unexpected scenarios, and complete tasks without predefined workflows.

## Quick Start

Create and run an agent in a few lines:

<AgentQuickstart />

<Tip>
  Agents run within [browser sessions](/concepts/sessions). Use context managers to ensure sessions are automatically stopped when done. This prevents orphaned sessions and unexpected costs.
</Tip>

## How Agents Work

### 1. Observation

The agent observes the current page state:
- Visible elements and their properties
- Interactive components (buttons, forms, links)
- Text content and structure
- Current URL and page metadata

### 2. Reasoning

Using the LLM, the agent:
- Understands the current page
- Plans the next action to complete the task
- Decides which element to interact with
- Determines when the task is complete

### 3. Action

The agent executes browser actions:
- Navigate to URLs
- Click buttons and links
- Fill forms
- Extract data
- Scroll and interact with dynamic content

### 4. Iteration

This cycle repeats until:
- The task is successfully completed
- Maximum steps are reached
- An error occurs that can't be resolved

## Agents vs Scripted Automation

Both agents and scripted automation run on [browser sessions](/concepts/sessions)—the cloud browser infrastructure. The difference is how you control what happens in that session.

| Aspect | Scripted Automation | Agent |
|--------|---------------------|-------|
| **Control** | You write the code | AI decides each step |
| **Flexibility** | Fixed workflow | Adapts to changes |
| **Speed** | Fast (direct execution) | Slower (LLM reasoning per step) |
| **Cost** | Browser minutes only | Browser minutes + LLM calls |
| **Reliability** | Deterministic | Can vary based on page state |
| **Use Case** | Known, stable workflows | Unknown or dynamic workflows |

**Use scripted automation when:**
- You know the exact steps to take
- Speed and cost are critical
- The target pages rarely change

**Use agents when:**
- You don't know the exact steps
- Pages change frequently
- You need intelligent decision-making

<Note>
  You can combine both approaches: use an agent to figure out a workflow, then [convert it to a function](/features/agents/workflows) for faster, cheaper repeated execution.

## Key Concepts

### Natural Language Tasks

Give instructions in plain English:

<NaturalLanguageTask />

### Structured Output

Get responses in a specific format:

<StructuredOutputExample />

### Starting URL

Begin at a specific page:

<StartingUrl />

### Step Limits

Control maximum actions:

<StepLimits />

## Error Handling

Agents can fail for various reasons. Always check the result:
