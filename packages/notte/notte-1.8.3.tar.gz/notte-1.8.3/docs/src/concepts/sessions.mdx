Sessions are isolated browser instances running in the cloud that you can control programmatically. Think of them as headless Chrome browsers, but managed, scalable, and equipped with anti-detection, proxies, and captcha solving out of the box.

Every operation in Notte—whether you're running an AI agent, scraping data, or automating a workflow—happens within a session.

## Quick Start

Create a session and start automating:

<SessionsPython />

<Tip>
  We strongly recommend using the `with` statement (context manager) to ensure sessions are automatically stopped when done. This prevents orphaned sessions and unexpected costs. See [Session Lifecycle](/features/sessions/lifecycle) for manual management options.
</Tip>

## Core Operations

Sessions provide three methods for interacting with the browser:

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `observe()` | Get the current page state and available actions |
| `execute()` | Perform an action on the page |
| `scrape()` | Extract structured data from the page |
