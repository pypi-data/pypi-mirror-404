Debug agent executions with MP4 replays that show exactly what the agent saw and did during its run.

## Agent Replay

Get a visual replay of the agent's execution:

<BasicReplay />

## What's Included

Agent replays capture:

- **Visual recording** of every page the agent visited
- **Actions taken** by the agent (clicks, fills, navigations)
- **Page transitions** and loading states
- **Element highlights** showing what the agent interacted with
- **Timestamps** for each action

## Viewing Replays

### In Jupyter Notebook

Display the replay inline:

<ViewInNotebook />

### Save to File

Save for later viewing or sharing:

<SaveToFile />

### In Browser

Use the Notte Console to view replays:

<ViewInBrowser />

## Debugging Workflow

### 1. Run Agent

Execute your agent task:

<RunAgent />

### 2. Check If Failed

Identify failures:

<CheckIfFailed />

### 3. Inspect Steps

Review what the agent did:

<InspectSteps />

### 4. Watch Replay

See the visual execution:

<WatchReplay />

### 5. Fix and Retry

Adjust based on findings:

<FixAndRetry />

## Common Issues

### Agent Can't Find Element

**Symptoms:**
- Agent fails with "Element not found"
- Replay shows element exists but wasn't clicked

**Debug:**

<DebugMissingElement />

**Fix:**

<FixMissingElement />

### Agent Takes Wrong Action

**Symptoms:**
- Agent clicks wrong button
- Agent fills wrong form field

**Debug:**

<DebugWrongAction />

**Fix:**

<FixWrongAction />

### Agent Exceeds Max Steps

**Symptoms:**
- Agent stops before completing task
- `len(result.steps) == max_steps`

**Debug:**

<DebugMaxSteps />

**Fix:**

<FixMaxSteps />

## Advanced Debugging

### Step-by-Step Analysis

Inspect each step in detail:

<StepByStepAnalysis />

### Comparing Runs

Compare successful vs failed runs:

<ComparingRuns />

### Agent Status During Execution

Monitor agent in real-time:

<MonitorStatus />

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Review Failed Agents

Don't ignore failures - watch the replay:

<ReviewFailedAgents />

### 2. Save Replays for Production Issues

Keep replays of production failures:

<SaveProductionReplays />

### 3. Use Replays for QA

Verify agent behavior before deploying:

<ReplaysForQa />

### 4. Share Replays with Team

Save and share for collaboration:

<ShareWithTeam />

## Limitations

Replays are currently:

- ✅ Available for all completed agents
- ✅ Full video recording of execution
- ✅ Include element highlights
- ⚠️  Generated after completion (not real-time)
- ⚠️  May be large files for long runs
