Notte sessions can be controlled with Selenium 4's CDP support. This allows you to use Selenium's WebDriver API while benefiting from Notte's cloud infrastructure, anti-detection features, and session management.

## Prerequisites

Install Selenium 4+ alongside the Notte SDK:

```bash
pip install notte-sdk selenium>=4.0.0
```

<Note>
  Selenium 4 or higher is required for CDP support. Earlier versions do not support connecting to remote browsers via CDP.
</Note>

## Connect Selenium to Notte Session

Start a Notte session and connect Selenium to it using the CDP URL:

<SeleniumConnect />

<Warning>
  The CDP connection approach shown above works in most cases, but Selenium's CDP support may vary by version. For more reliable connections, consider using the Remote WebDriver approach below.
</Warning>

## Alternative: Using Notte's Built-in Page

A more reliable way is to use Notte's built-in Playwright page directly:

<SeleniumPlaywrightAlternative />

<Tip>
  For Python-based automation with Notte, we recommend using **Playwright** instead of Selenium. Notte sessions include a built-in Playwright page (`session.page`) that's easier to use and better integrated.
</Tip>

## Basic Web Automation

If you're using Selenium with Notte, here's a basic example using Playwright (recommended):

<SeleniumBasicAutomation />

## Finding Elements

Use Playwright-style element selection with Notte's page:

<SeleniumFindingElements />

## Waiting for Elements

Wait for elements to appear or conditions to be met:

<SeleniumWaitingElements />

## Taking Screenshots

Capture screenshots during automation:

<SeleniumScreenshots />

## Executing JavaScript

Run custom JavaScript in the page context:

<SeleniumJavascript />

## Handling Alerts and Dialogs

Manage browser dialogs using Playwright:

<SeleniumDialogs />

## Working with Frames

Access iframe content:

<SeleniumFrames />

## Why Use Playwright Instead of Selenium?

For Notte sessions, **Playwright is recommended over Selenium** because:

1. **Native Integration**: Notte sessions include a built-in Playwright page (`session.page`)
2. **Better API**: Playwright has a modern, async-friendly API with better selectors
3. **Auto-waiting**: Playwright automatically waits for elements to be ready
4. **Network Control**: Built-in network interception and mocking
5. **Multiple Contexts**: Easier to manage multiple browser contexts
6. **Better Performance**: Playwright is generally faster and more reliable

### Selenium is best when:
- You have existing Selenium test suites you want to migrate
- Your team is already trained in Selenium
- You're using Selenium Grid infrastructure

### Playwright is best when:
- You're starting a new automation project
- You want modern browser automation features
- You value simplicity and better debugging

## Migration from Selenium

If you're migrating from Selenium, here's a quick comparison:

| Selenium | Playwright (Notte) |
|----------|-------------------|
| `driver.get(url)` | `page.goto(url)` |
| `driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "button")` | `page.locator("button")` |
| `element.click()` | `page.click("button")` |
| `element.send_keys("text")` | `page.fill("input", "text")` |
| `driver.execute_script("...")` | `page.evaluate("...")` |
| `WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(...)` | `page.wait_for_selector("...")` |
| `driver.save_screenshot("path")` | `page.screenshot(path="path")` |

## Complete Example: Form Automation

Here's a complete example using Playwright with Notte (recommended approach):

<SeleniumForm />

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Playwright Instead

For new projects with Notte, use Playwright instead of Selenium:

<SeleniumBuiltinPage />

### 2. Explicit Waits

Always wait for elements before interacting:

<SeleniumExplicitWaits />

### 3. Unique Selectors

Use unique, stable selectors:

<SeleniumUniqueSelectors />

### 4. Error Handling

Wrap operations in try-except blocks:

<SeleniumErrorHandling />
