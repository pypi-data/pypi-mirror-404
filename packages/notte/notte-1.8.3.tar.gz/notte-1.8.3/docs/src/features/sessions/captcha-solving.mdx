Notte can automatically detect and solve captchas including reCAPTCHA v2, reCAPTCHA v3, and hCaptcha during your browser automation.

<Warning>
  CAPTCHA solving is only available with Firefox. You must set `browser_type="firefox"` to use this feature.
</Warning>

## Quick Start

Enable captcha solving when creating a session:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()

  with client.Session(
      browser_type="firefox",  # Required
      solve_captchas=True
  ) as session:
      page = session.page
      page.goto("https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo")
      # Captcha automatically solved
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Supported CAPTCHA Types

Notte automatically detects and solves:

- ✅ **reCAPTCHA v2** - Checkbox and image challenges
- ✅ **reCAPTCHA v3** - Invisible captchas
- ✅ **hCaptcha** - Checkbox and image challenges

## How It Works

When captcha solving is enabled:

1. **Detection** - Notte monitors the page for captcha elements
2. **Solving** - Captchas are solved automatically in the background
3. **Continuation** - Your automation continues seamlessly

No additional code is needed - captchas are solved automatically when encountered.

## Complete Example

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()

  with client.Session(
      browser_type="firefox",
      solve_captchas=True,
      headless=False  # Watch it solve captchas
  ) as session:
      page = session.page

      # Navigate to a site with captcha
      page.goto("https://example.com/login")

      # Fill login form
      page.fill('input[name="email"]', "user@example.com")
      page.fill('input[name="password"]', "password")

      # Click submit - captcha will be solved automatically
      page.click('button[type="submit"]')

      # Wait for successful login
      page.wait_for_url("**/dashboard")
      print("Logged in successfully!")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Captcha + Proxies

Combine captcha solving with proxies for better success rates:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()

  with client.Session(
      browser_type="firefox",
      solve_captchas=True,
      proxies=True  # Use residential proxies
  ) as session:
      page = session.page
      page.goto("https://example.com")
      # Both captcha solving and proxies active
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Realistic Delays

Add human-like delays before and after captcha-protected actions:

<RealisticDelays />

### 2. Monitor for Failures

Check if captcha solving failed:

<MonitorFailures />

### 3. Use Headless=False for Debugging

Watch captcha solving in action:

<HeadlessDebug />

### 4. Combine with Stealth

Use stealth features for better success rates:

<CombineStealth />

## Limitations

### What CAPTCHA Solving Can Do:
- ✅ Solve most reCAPTCHA v2 challenges
- ✅ Solve reCAPTCHA v3 automatically
- ✅ Solve most hCaptcha challenges
- ✅ Work with residential proxies
- ✅ Work in headless and non-headless mode

### What It Cannot Do:
- ❌ Solve 100% of captchas (some are unsolvable)
- ❌ Work with Chromium or Chrome (Firefox only)
- ❌ Solve custom/proprietary captcha systems
- ❌ Bypass all bot detection (combine with stealth)

## Common Issues

### Issue: Captchas Not Being Solved

**Possible causes:**
- Using Chromium/Chrome instead of Firefox
- `solve_captchas=True` not set
- Captcha type not supported
- Site has additional bot detection

**Solution:**

### Issue: Timeout Waiting for Captcha

Increase session timeout for captcha-heavy workflows:

## Testing CAPTCHA Solving

Test captcha solving on demo sites:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()

  test_sites = [
      "https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo",
      "https://2captcha.com/demo/recaptcha-v2",
      "https://democaptcha.com/demo-form-eng/hcaptcha.html"
  ]

  with client.Session(
      browser_type="firefox",
      solve_captchas=True,
      headless=False
  ) as session:
      page = session.page

      for site in test_sites:
          print(f"Testing {site}")
          page.goto(site)
          page.screenshot(path=f"captcha_test_{test_sites.index(site)}.png")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Pricing

CAPTCHA solving incurs additional costs based on the number of captchas solved. Check your plan for details.
