Notte sessions expose a Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) endpoint that you can connect to with Puppeteer. Since Puppeteer is a Node.js library and Notte SDK is Python-based, this guide shows how to connect them together.

## Prerequisites

Install Puppeteer in your Node.js project:

```bash
npm install puppeteer-core
```

<Note>
  Use `puppeteer-core` instead of `puppeteer` since you're connecting to a remote browser rather than launching a local one.
</Note>

## Approach 1: Start Session from Python

Start a Notte session in Python and connect Puppeteer to it:

<PuppeteerPythonStart />

## Approach 2: Use Notte REST API

Call the Notte API directly from Node.js to create sessions:

<PuppeteerRestApi />

## Network Interception

Use Puppeteer's request interception with Notte sessions:

<PuppeteerNetwork />

## Page Manipulation

Use Puppeteer's API for advanced page interactions:

<PuppeteerManipulation />

## Multiple Pages

Create and manage multiple pages with Puppeteer:

<PuppeteerMultiplePages />

## Event Monitoring

Listen to browser events using Puppeteer:

<PuppeteerEvents />

## Screenshots and PDFs

Generate screenshots and PDFs using Puppeteer:

<PuppeteerScreenshots />

## Best Practices

### 1. Use puppeteer-core

Always use `puppeteer-core` instead of `puppeteer` since you're connecting to a remote browser:

```bash
npm install puppeteer-core
```

### 2. Handle Disconnections

CDP connections can be interrupted. Always wrap operations in try-catch:

```javascript
try {
  const browser = await puppeteer.connect({
    browserWSEndpoint: cdpUrl
  });
  // ... operations
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Connection failed:', error);
}
```

### 3. Disconnect Properly

Always disconnect the browser when done:

```javascript
try {
  // ... operations
} finally {
  await browser.disconnect();
}
```

### 4. Session Timeout

Remember that Notte sessions have a timeout. Set an appropriate value when creating the session:

<PuppeteerSessionTimeout />

### 5. Environment Variables

Store your Notte API key in environment variables:

```javascript
const API_KEY = process.env.NOTTE_API_KEY;
```

## Complete Example: Web Scraping

Here's a complete example combining Notte and Puppeteer for web scraping:

<PuppeteerComplete />

## When to Use Puppeteer with Notte

Use Puppeteer directly when you need:

- **Node.js ecosystem**: Integrate with Node.js applications and packages
- **Familiar Puppeteer API**: You're already comfortable with Puppeteer's API
- **Request interception**: Block resources or modify requests
- **Performance monitoring**: Track page metrics and performance
- **PDF generation**: Create PDFs from web pages

For Python-based automation, consider using Playwright with Notte instead, as it has better Python integration.
