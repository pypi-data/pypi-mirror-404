Notte sessions include built-in stealth features to help your automations avoid detection by anti-bot systems.

## Built-in Stealth Features

All Notte sessions automatically include:

- **Clean browser fingerprints** - Realistic browser signatures
- **Navigator properties** - Proper webdriver, plugins, and language settings
- **Canvas fingerprinting protection** - Randomized canvas signatures
- **WebGL fingerprinting protection** - Unique WebGL parameters
- **Timezone and locale matching** - Consistent geolocation data
- **Chrome DevTools Protocol hiding** - CDP detection prevention

## Basic Usage

Stealth features are enabled by default. Simply create a session:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()

  with client.Session() as session:
      page = session.page
      page.goto("https://bot-detection-test.com")
      # Stealth features automatically active
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Enhanced Stealth with Proxies

Combine stealth mode with residential proxies for maximum anonymity:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()

  with client.Session(
      proxies=True,  # Enable residential proxies
      browser_type="chrome"  # Use Chrome for best compatibility
  ) as session:
      page = session.page
      page.goto("https://example.com")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Custom User Agents

Override the default user agent for specific requirements:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()

  with client.Session(
      user_agent="Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36"
  ) as session:
      page = session.page
      page.goto("https://example.com")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Stealth Best Practices

### 1. Use Realistic Behavior

Avoid patterns that look automated:

<RealisticBehavior />

### 2. Rotate Proxies

Use different proxies for different sessions:

<RotateProxies />

### 3. Match Viewport to Real Devices

Use common screen resolutions:

<MatchViewport />

### 4. Combine Multiple Techniques

Layer stealth features for best results:

<CombineTechniques />

## Testing Stealth

Test your stealth configuration against detection services:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()

  test_sites = [
      "https://bot.sannysoft.com/",
      "https://arh.antoinevastel.com/bots/areyouheadless",
      "https://fingerprint.com/demo/"
  ]

  with client.Session(proxies=True) as session:
      page = session.page

      for site in test_sites:
          page.goto(site)
          page.screenshot(path=f"stealth_test_{site.split('//')[1].split('/')[0]}.png")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## What Stealth Can't Do

Stealth features help avoid detection, but they cannot:

- ❌ Bypass login rate limits (use delays between attempts)
- ❌ Avoid behavioral analysis (act like a human)
- ❌ Bypass IP-based blocking (use proxy rotation)
- ❌ Solve all captchas automatically (use captcha solving)

## Stealth + Captcha Solving

Combine stealth with automatic captcha solving for comprehensive protection:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()

  with client.Session(
      browser_type="firefox",  # Required for captcha solving
      solve_captchas=True,
      proxies=True
  ) as session:
      page = session.page
      page.goto("https://example.com/login")
      # Both stealth and captcha solving active
  ```
</CodeGroup>
