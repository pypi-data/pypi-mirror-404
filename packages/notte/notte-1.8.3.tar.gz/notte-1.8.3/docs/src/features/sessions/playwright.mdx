Notte sessions expose a Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) endpoint that you can connect to with Playwright. This allows you to use Playwright's API directly while still benefiting from Notte's cloud infrastructure, anti-detection features, and session management.

## Prerequisites

Install Playwright alongside the Notte SDK:

```bash
pip install notte-sdk playwright
```

## Connect Playwright to Notte Session

Get the CDP URL from a Notte session and connect Playwright to it:

<PlaywrightConnect />

<Note>
  Notte sessions automatically create a browser context with one page. Access it via `browser.contexts[0].pages[0]`.
</Note>

## Use Both Notte and Playwright APIs

You can use both the Notte session API and Playwright simultaneously:

<PlaywrightBothApis />

## Async Playwright Support

Notte works with both sync and async Playwright:

<PlaywrightAsync />

## Advanced: Multiple Pages and Contexts

Create additional pages or contexts using Playwright:

<PlaywrightMultiplePages />

## Network Interception

Use Playwright's powerful network interception with Notte sessions:

<PlaywrightNetwork />

## Browser Events and Monitoring

Listen to browser events using Playwright:

<PlaywrightEvents />

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Context Managers

Always use context managers for both Notte and Playwright to ensure proper cleanup:

<PlaywrightContextManagers />

### 2. Prefer Notte's Built-in Page

For simple automation, use `session.page` directly. Only connect Playwright when you need advanced features like network interception or custom contexts.

### 3. Session Timeout

Remember that Notte sessions have a timeout. For long-running Playwright operations, increase the timeout:

<PlaywrightTimeout />

### 4. Handle CDP Disconnections

CDP connections can be interrupted. Wrap operations in try-except blocks:

<PlaywrightCdpErrorHandling />

## When to Use Playwright with Notte

Use Playwright directly when you need:

- **Network interception**: Block resources, modify requests/responses
- **Advanced event monitoring**: Console logs, network events, page errors
- **Multiple contexts**: Separate browser contexts with different settings
- **Custom browser settings**: Specific viewport, user agent, or permissions per context
- **Playwright's testing utilities**: Screenshots with full-page scrolling, PDF generation, etc.

For most automation tasks, `session.page` (which is already Playwright-compatible) is sufficient.
