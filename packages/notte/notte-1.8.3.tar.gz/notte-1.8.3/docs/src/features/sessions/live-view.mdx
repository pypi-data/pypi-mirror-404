Live View allows you to watch your browser sessions in real-time as they execute, making it easy to debug and monitor automation.

## Quick Start

Open a live viewer automatically when the session starts:

<QuickStart />

## Manual Live View

Open the live viewer manually at any point during the session:

<ManualViewer />

## Viewer Types

Notte supports multiple viewer types:

### Browser Viewer (Default)

Frame-by-frame replay in your browser:

<ViewerBrowser />

### CDP Viewer

Chrome DevTools Protocol debugger:

<ViewerCdp />

### Jupyter Notebook Viewer

Display live view directly in Jupyter notebooks:

<ViewerNotebook />

## Live View for Agents

Watch AI agents make decisions in real-time:

<AgentViewer />

## Sharing Live View

Share the viewer URL with your team for collaborative debugging:

<SharingViewer />

## Viewer Configuration

Set a default viewer type for all sessions:

<ViewerConfig />

Available viewer types:
- `SessionViewerType.BROWSER` - Frame-by-frame browser viewer (default)
- `SessionViewerType.CDP` - Chrome DevTools Protocol debugger
- `SessionViewerType.JUPYTER` - Jupyter notebook display

## Best Practices

### 1. Use for Development

Live view is ideal for development and debugging:

<DevEnvironment />

### 2. Combine with Recordings

Use live view during development, recordings for later analysis:

<CombineWithRecordings />

### 3. Multiple Viewers

Open multiple viewer types simultaneously:

<MultipleViewers />

## Live View vs Recordings

| Feature | Live View | Recordings |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Timing** | Real-time during execution | After session ends |
| **Interactivity** | Can observe as it happens | Playback only |
| **Use Case** | Debugging, monitoring | Archiving, sharing |
| **Availability** | During session only | 24 hours after session |
