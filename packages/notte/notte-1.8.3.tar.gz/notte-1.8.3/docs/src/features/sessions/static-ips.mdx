title: Static IPs
description: Use dedicated static IP addresses for your browser sessions
---

Static IPs provide dedicated, unchanging IP addresses for your browser sessions. This is essential for scenarios where IP reputation matters, such as accessing services that whitelist specific IPs or maintaining consistent identity across sessions.

## Key Benefits

- **IP whitelisting** - Use with services that require pre-approved IP addresses
- **Consistent identity** - Maintain the same IP across multiple sessions
- **Reputation building** - Build trust with target websites over time
- **Compliance** - Meet security requirements for enterprise integrations
