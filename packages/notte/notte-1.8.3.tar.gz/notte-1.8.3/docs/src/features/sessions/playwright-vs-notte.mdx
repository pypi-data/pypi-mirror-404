When working with Notte sessions, you have two ways to interact with the browser: using Playwright directly via CDP, or using Notte's AI-enabled SDK methods. Both approaches work with the same session, and you can even mix them in your automation.

## Direct Playwright Control

When you access `session.page`, you get a Playwright-compatible page object that connects directly to the browser via Chrome DevTools Protocol:

<PlaywrightDirect />

This gives you the full Playwright API - everything you can do with Playwright works here. You control the browser directly through WebSocket connections with low latency.

## Notte SDK Methods

Notte provides high-level methods designed for AI agents and structured automation:

These methods use Notte's backend to execute actions, with built-in AI capabilities, observability, and error handling.

## Key Differences

| Feature | Playwright (`session.page`) | Notte SDK (`execute/observe/scrape`) |
|---------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **API Surface** | Full Playwright API | Streamlined action-based API |
| **Dependencies** | Requires `playwright` package | Just `notte-sdk` |
| **Element Selection** | Manual CSS/XPath selectors | AI-powered natural language + selectors |
| **Page Understanding** | Manual interpretation | AI describes page with `observe()` |
| **Data Extraction** | Manual parsing | Structured LLM-powered `scrape()` |
| **Observability** | Manual logging | Session replay, action recording, live viewer |
| **Error Handling** | Manual try/except | Automatic retries and validation |
| **Network Control** | ✅ Intercept, modify requests | ❌ Not available |
| **Latency** | Lower (WebSocket) | Higher (HTTP API) |
| **Action Coverage** | Everything | Everything via extensive action library |

## Why Use Playwright?

Choose `session.page` when you need:

- **Network control** - Intercept, block, or modify requests and responses
- **Event monitoring** - Listen to console logs, network events, page errors
- **Lowest latency** - Direct WebSocket communication for high-speed operations
- **Standard patterns** - Use familiar Playwright code and examples
- **Fine-grained control** - Access to every Playwright feature

## Why Use Notte SDK?

Choose `session.execute()`, `observe()`, and `scrape()` when you need:

- **AI-powered automation** - Let AI find elements and understand pages
- **Structured data extraction** - Extract data into Pydantic models automatically
- **Built-in observability** - Session replays, trajectory tracking, live viewer
- **Simpler API** - Smaller learning curve, no Playwright knowledge required
- **Production reliability** - Automatic retries, error handling, validation
- **Agent workflows** - Designed for AI agents with semantic action spaces

## Mix Both Approaches

You can combine both methods in the same session:

<MixBoth />

## When to Choose What

### Use Playwright if:
- You need network interception or request modification
- You're integrating existing Playwright scripts
- Performance is critical (milliseconds matter)
- You need to listen to browser events

### Use Notte SDK if:
- Building AI agents that understand web pages
- You want structured data extraction
- You need session replay and debugging features
- You prefer simpler, action-based API
- Building production systems with error handling

### Use Both if:
- You need network control AND AI features
- Complex workflows with different requirements
- You want the flexibility of both approaches
