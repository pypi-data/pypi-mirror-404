Notte automatically records every action in your browser sessions, allowing you to download video replays for debugging and analysis.

## Quick Start

Get a recording after your session ends:

<QuickStart />

## What Gets Recorded

Session recordings capture:

- **Page navigation** - All page loads and URL changes
- **User interactions** - Clicks, fills, scrolls, key presses
- **DOM changes** - Dynamic content updates
- **Visual state** - What the browser displays
- **Timing** - Real-time playback speed

## Session Replays

### Download as MP4

<DownloadMp4 />

### Replay by Session ID

Get a replay for any session using its ID:

<ReplayById />

## Agent Replays

Agents have their own replay method for convenience:

<AgentReplay />

You can also get the replay from the session:

<AgentReplayAlt />

## Debugging Failed Runs

Use recordings to understand what went wrong:

<DebugFailed />

## Best Practices

### 1. Name Recordings Meaningfully

Use descriptive filenames:

<NameRecordings />

### 2. Record Only on Failures

For production, save recordings only when something goes wrong:

<RecordOnFailures />

### 3. Clean Up Old Recordings

Remove old recordings to save disk space:

<CleanupOld />

## Recording Limitations

### What's Recorded
- All page interactions
- Visual state changes
- Navigation and reloads
- Dynamic content

### What's NOT Recorded
- Audio
- Network request details (use CDP for this)
- Console logs (use logging)
- Session state before first action

## Storage

Recordings are:
- Stored temporarily on Notte's servers
- Available after session ends
- **Retained for 24 hours**
- Downloadable as MP4

<Warning>
  Recordings are deleted after 24 hours. Download them promptly if needed for later analysis.
</Warning>
