Manage the lifecycle of your Functions including updates, versioning, monitoring executions, and viewing replays.

## Viewing Functions

### List All Functions

View all deployed Functions:

<ListFunctions />

### Get Function Details

Retrieve specific Function information:

<GetFunctionDetails />

## Updating Functions

### Update Function Code

Deploy a new version of your Function:

<UpdateCode />

### Update Function Metadata

Change Function name or description:

```python
# Update metadata (via console or API)
# Name and description updates are available through the Console
```

**Note:** Function updates create new versions automatically. Previous versions remain accessible for rollback.

## Versioning

### Version Management

Functions automatically version on each update:

<VersionManagement />

### Run Specific Version

Execute a specific Function version:

<RunSpecificVersion />

### Version History

Track changes across versions:

<VersionHistory />

## Monitoring Executions

### View Run History

List recent Function executions:

<ViewRunHistory />

### Check Run Status

Monitor specific execution:

<CheckRunStatus />

**Status values:**
- `active` - Function is currently running
- `closed` - Function completed successfully
- `failed` - Function encountered an error

### Filter Active Runs

View only running executions:

<FilterActiveRuns />

## Viewing Replays

### Access Function Replay

Watch MP4 replay of Function execution:

<AccessReplay />

**Replay features:**
- Video recording of browser session
- Shows all actions taken
- Useful for debugging failures
- Available after running a function

### Replay After Run

Get replay immediately after execution:

<ReplayAfterRun />

## Managing Runs

### Stop Running Function

Cancel a long-running execution:

<StopRunning />

### Monitoring Long Runs

Track execution progress:

<MonitorRuns />

## Forking Functions

### Fork Shared Function

Create your own copy of a shared Function:

<ForkFunction />

**Use cases:**
- Customize shared Functions
- Create templates from marketplace
- Copy teammate's Functions
- Experiment without affecting original

### Modify Forked Function

After forking, update as needed:

<ModifyForked />

## Downloading Functions

### Download Function Code

Retrieve Function source code:

<DownloadCode />

**Requirements:**
- Decryption key (available in Console) - passed when creating Function instance
- Only works for Functions you own or have access to

### Download for Backup

Back up all your Functions:

<BackupFunctions />

## Deleting Functions

### Delete Function

Remove a Function permanently:

<DeleteFunction />

**Warning:**
- Deletion is permanent
- All versions are deleted
- Run history is preserved
- Cannot be undone

## Sharing Functions

### Make Function Public

Share Functions with others:

<MakePublic />

**Shared Functions:**
- ✅ Others can view and fork
- ✅ Original remains under your control
- ❌ Others cannot modify your version
- ✅ Usage tracked to your account

### Private Functions

Keep Functions private (default):

<PrivateFunction />

## Best Practices

### 1. Version Your Functions

Update incrementally with clear changes:

<VersionBackup />

### 2. Monitor Function Health

Regular health checks:

<FunctionHealthCheck />

### 3. Clean Up Old Runs

Archive or analyze old execution data:

<CleanupOldRuns />

### 4. Document Changes

Keep change log for Function updates:

<DocumentChanges />

### 5. Test Before Production

Validate updates before deploying:

<TestBeforeProd />

## Troubleshooting

### Function Fails to Run

Check run details for errors:

<TroubleshootFails />

### Missing Environment Variables

Verify configuration:

<MissingEnvVars />

### High Failure Rate

Analyze failure patterns:

<HighFailureRate />
