Schedule Functions to run automatically at specific times using cron expressions.

## Overview

Function scheduling allows you to:
- Run automations on a regular schedule (daily, weekly, hourly, etc.)
- Execute tasks at specific times
- Automate recurring workflows
- Monitor websites continuously

Schedules are configured in the [Notte Console](https://console.notte.cc) and run automatically on Notte's infrastructure.

## Creating a Schedule

### Via Console

1. Go to [console.notte.cc/workflows](https://console.notte.cc/workflows)
2. Select your Function
3. Click "Schedule"
4. Enter cron expression
5. Set parameters (variables)
6. Save schedule

### Cron Expression Format

Cron expressions define when Functions run:

```
* * * * *
│ │ │ │ │
│ │ │ │ └─── Day of week (0-6, Sunday=0)
│ │ │ └───── Month (1-12)
│ │ └─────── Day of month (1-31)
│ └───────── Hour (0-23)
└─────────── Minute (0-59)
```

## Common Schedules

### Every Minute

```
* * * * *
```

Run function every minute.

**Use for:** Real-time monitoring, high-frequency updates

---

### Every Hour

```
0 * * * *
```

Run at the start of every hour (e.g., 1:00, 2:00, 3:00).

**Use for:** Hourly data collection, periodic checks

---

### Every Day at 9 AM

```
0 9 * * *
```

Run every day at 9:00 AM.

**Use for:** Daily reports, morning data sync

---

### Every Monday at 8 AM

```
0 8 * * 1
```

Run every Monday at 8:00 AM.

**Use for:** Weekly reports, start-of-week tasks

---

### First Day of Month

```
0 0 1 * *
```

Run at midnight on the 1st of every month.

**Use for:** Monthly reports, billing cycles

---

### Every 15 Minutes

```
*/15 * * * *
```

Run every 15 minutes.

**Use for:** Frequent monitoring, regular updates

---

### Weekdays at 6 PM

```
0 18 * * 1-5
```

Run at 6:00 PM Monday through Friday.

**Use for:** End-of-day business tasks

---

### Multiple Times Per Day

```
0 9,12,15,18 * * *
```

Run at 9 AM, 12 PM, 3 PM, and 6 PM every day.

**Use for:** Regular business hours monitoring

---

## Use Cases

### 1. Daily Price Monitoring

Monitor competitor pricing every day:

<PriceMonitor />

**Schedule:** `0 9 * * *` (Every day at 9 AM)

---

### 2. Hourly Data Collection

Collect data every hour:

<HourlyDataCollection />

**Schedule:** `0 * * * *` (Every hour)

---

### 3. Weekly Reports

Generate reports every Monday:

<WeeklyReports />

**Schedule:** `0 8 * * 1` (Every Monday at 8 AM)

---

### 4. Continuous Monitoring

Monitor website availability every 5 minutes:

<UptimeMonitor />

**Schedule:** `*/5 * * * *` (Every 5 minutes)

---

## Schedule Parameters

### Static Parameters

Set fixed parameters for scheduled runs:

```
Schedule: 0 9 * * *
Parameters:
  url: "https://example.com"
  max_results: 10
```

Every scheduled run uses these parameters.

### Dynamic Parameters

Use environment variables or context:

<DynamicParams />

## Managing Schedules

### View Scheduled Runs

Check upcoming scheduled executions in the Console:

1. Go to Function details
2. View "Scheduled Runs" section
3. See next execution time
4. View execution history

### Pause Schedule

Temporarily disable schedule:

1. Go to Function schedules
2. Toggle schedule off
3. Resume later without losing configuration

### Delete Schedule

Remove schedule permanently:

1. Go to Function schedules
2. Delete schedule
3. Function can still be invoked manually

## Monitoring Scheduled Functions

### Execution History

View past scheduled runs:

<ExecutionHistory />

### Failed Runs

Handle scheduled failures:

<FailedRuns />

### Alerts

Set up alerts for failures:

<Alerts />

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Appropriate Frequency

Match schedule to data update frequency:

```
# Data updates hourly
0 * * * *  ✅ Good

# Data updates hourly, but checking every minute
* * * * *  ❌ Wasteful
```

### 2. Add Error Handling

Scheduled functions should handle errors gracefully:

<ErrorHandling />

### 3. Set Reasonable Timeouts

<SetTimeouts />

### 4. Monitor Schedule Health

Check that schedules are running:

<HealthCheck />

**Schedule:** `0 0 * * *` (Daily health check)

### 5. Use Idempotent Operations

Design functions to handle duplicate runs:

<Idempotent />

## Timezone Considerations

Schedules run in UTC by default. Convert to your timezone:

```python
# If you want 9 AM EST (UTC-5), use:
# 14 * * * * (9 AM + 5 hours = 14:00 UTC)

# If you want 9 AM PST (UTC-8), use:
# 17 * * * * (9 AM + 8 hours = 17:00 UTC)
```

Or handle timezone in function:

<Timezone />
