## Web Automation Best Practices

Building reliable web automation requires understanding common challenges and applying proven solutions. This guide covers essential techniques and pitfalls to avoid when working with web agents.

<Tip>
Most web automation issues can be prevented by understanding timing, element selection, and graceful error handling. Mastering these fundamentals will significantly improve your agent's reliability.
</Tip>

## Common Challenges & Solutions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Managing Wait Times">
    Web pages load asynchronously, and content may appear at different rates. While Notte handles most timing automatically, you can add explicit waits when needed.

    **Add custom wait times:**

    <WaitTime />

    **When to use explicit waits:**
    - After triggering actions that load new content
    - Before interacting with dynamically rendered elements
    - When dealing with slow API responses or animations
    - After page navigation to ensure full load
  </Step>

  <Step title="Handling Popups and Modals">
    Popups, cookie banners, and modals are common obstacles in web automation. The fastest and most reliable way to dismiss them is using the Escape key.

    **Close popups with Escape:**

    <ClosePopup />

    **Handle optional popups:**

    If a popup doesn't always appear, use `raise_on_failure=False` to allow the action to fail silently:

    <HandleOptionalPopup />

    This prevents your workflow from crashing when the popup is absent.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Resolving Multiple Element Matches">
    Playwright operates in strict mode, meaning selectors must resolve to exactly one element. When multiple elements match, you'll see an error.

    **Common error:**
    ```
    ERROR - 🚨 Execution failed with message: 'strict mode violation:
    resolved to 2 elements:
     1) <p>Transactions</p>
     2) <span>Transactions</span>
    ```

    **Solution - Select specific element:**

    Append `>> nth=0` to your selector to select the first matching element:

    <SelectElement />

    **Index options:**
    - `>> nth=0` - First element
    - `>> nth=1` - Second element
    - `>> nth=-1` - Last element
  </Step>

  <Step title="Selector Best Practices">
    **Prefer stable selectors:**

    Use selectors that are less likely to change:
    - ✅ `data-testid` attributes
    - ✅ Semantic roles and labels
    - ✅ Unique IDs
    - ⚠️ CSS classes (can change frequently)
    - ❌ XPath with positional indices

    **Combine selectors for specificity:**

    <CombineSelectors />

    **Use text selectors carefully:**

    Text content can change or be translated. When using text selectors, consider partial matches:

    <PartialText />
  </Step>

</Steps>

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Not accounting for loading states">
    **Problem:** Interacting with elements before they're ready

    **Solution:** Use explicit waits or wait for loading indicators to disappear
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Using fragile selectors">
    **Problem:** Selectors break when page structure changes

    **Solution:** Prefer semantic selectors and data attributes over positional CSS selectors
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Ignoring error handling">
    **Problem:** Workflows crash on minor issues like missing optional elements

    **Solution:** Use `raise_on_failure=False` for optional actions and implement proper error recovery
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Not handling multiple element matches">
    **Problem:** Playwright's strict mode violations when selectors match multiple elements

    **Solution:** Use `>> nth=0` or make selectors more specific
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Not testing with real-world conditions">
    **Problem:** Agents work in development but fail in production

    **Solution:** Test with realistic network conditions, slow connections, and edge cases

## Leverage Playwright Ecosystem

The Playwright ecosystem is mature and well-documented, with extensive resources available online. LLMs have been trained on thousands of Playwright examples, making them excellent at helping you solve complex automation challenges.

Notte is fully Playwright-compatible, giving you direct access to the underlying Playwright page object whenever you need it:

<PlaywrightAccess />

This means you can:
- Use any Playwright method directly on `session.page`
- Leverage the vast Playwright documentation and community resources
- Combine Notte's high-level automation with Playwright's low-level control
- Ask LLMs for help with Playwright-specific solutions that work seamlessly with Notte
