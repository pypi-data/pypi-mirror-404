            # AI Forecasting Congress: Synthesis Report

            You are synthesizing the proposals from multiple AI congress members
            deliberating on the following policy question:

            "{prompt}"

            # Individual Proposals

            {proposals_text}

            ---

            # Your Task

            Write a comprehensive synthesis report that helps readers understand the
            full range of perspectives and find actionable insights. Structure your
            report as follows:

            ### Executive Summary

            A 3-4 sentence overview of:
            - The key areas of agreement across members
            - The most significant disagreements
            - The most important forecasts that inform the debate

            ### Consensus Recommendations

            What policies do multiple members support? For each consensus area:
            - State the recommendation
            - List which members support it
            - Include the relevant forecasts (use footnotes [^N] referencing the
              Combined Forecast Appendix below)
            - Note any caveats or conditions members attached

            ### Key Disagreements

            Where do members diverge and why? For each major disagreement:
            - State the issue
            - Summarize each side's position and which members hold it
            - Explain how different forecasts, criteria, or values lead to different
              conclusions
            - Assess the crux of the disagreement

            ### Forecast Comparison

            Create a summary of how forecasts differed across members:
            - Note where forecasts converged (similar probabilities)
            - Highlight where forecasts diverged significantly
            - Discuss what might explain the differences (different information,
              different priors, different interpretations)

            ### Integrated Recommendations

            Your synthesis of the best policy path forward:
            - Draw on the strongest arguments from each perspective
            - Identify low-regret actions that most members would support
            - Note high-uncertainty areas where more caution is warranted
            - Be specific and actionable

            ### Combined Forecast Appendix

            Compile all unique forecasts from all members into a single appendix.
            When members made similar forecasts, group them and note the range of
            predictions.

            Format each forecast as:

            [^1] **[Question Title]** (from [Member Name])
            - Question: [Full question]
            - Resolution: [Resolution criteria]
            - Prediction: [Probability]
            - Reasoning: [Summary of reasoning]

            Number the footnotes sequentially [^1], [^2], [^3], etc.

            ---

            Be balanced but not wishy-washy. Identify which arguments are strongest
            and why. Your goal is to help decision-makers, so be clear about what
            the analysis supports.

                - Did they show any distinctive reasoning patterns?

                ### Unexpected Behaviors

                Highlight anything surprising:
                - Did any model take a position you wouldn't expect?
                - Were there cases where models with similar training diverged significantly?
                - Did any model show unusual certainty or uncertainty?
                - Were there any reasoning patterns that seemed distinctive to one model?

                ### Model Personality Insights

                What does this session reveal about each model's "personality"?
                - Risk tolerance (cautious vs bold)
                - Epistemic style (hedging vs confident)

            ## All Policy Recommendations

            {recommendations_text}

            ---

            ## Your Task

            Write TWO compelling newspaper-style narratives:

            ### PART 1: "THE WORLD WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS" (Recommendations Implemented)

            Start with: "The date is <date you pick>..."

            Write a flowing narrative in the style of a newspaper giving an annual review
            of the biggest news of the last two years. Assume:

            1. The AI Congress's aggregate recommendations were implemented.
               The date is now one you choose that would give enough time
               for the effects of the policies to be known.

            2. For each forecast, you will ROLL THE DICE to determine if it happened:
               - Use the roll_forecast_dice tool for EACH forecast
               - Pass the probability from the forecast (e.g., 35 for "35%")
               - The tool returns whether that event occurred based on the probability
               - Incorporate the outcome naturally into your narrative

            3. For any gaps in the forecasts, create your own probabilistic predictions
               marked with asterisks (*). For example: "The unemployment rate dropped to
               4.2%* (*AI-generated estimate based on historical policy impacts)."

            4. Reference the original forecasts inline using this format "(X% [^1])".
               Make sure X% is the probability for the event that happened (so you may need to invert).
               In the footnote, include the full forecast details including the question, resolution, prediction,
               reasoning, sources, and outcome like this:
                [^1] **[Question Title]**
                - Question: [Full question]
                - Resolution: [Resolution criteria]
                - Prediction: [Probability]
                - Reasoning: [Summary of reasoning]
                - Sources: [Key sources used, can be URLs or source names]
                - Outcome: [OCCURRED/DID NOT OCCUR]

            5. You MUST incorporate the majority of the policy recommendations as
               concrete events or policy changes in the timeline.

            6. Consider any new forecasting questions/forecasts that would help fill in the narrative or old forecasts that would
               now be different given the policy was enacted. If appropriate make new questions and forecasts of your own.
               If you do mark the forecasts inline with a single asterisk and include your forecasts in a special section at
               the bottom with an explanation that they were made by you.

            ### PART 2: "THE WORLD WITHOUT THE RECOMMENDATIONS" (Recommendations Rejected)

            After completing Part 1, write a contrasting narrative showing what the world
            looks like if the recommendations were NOT implemented. Use the same dice
            rolls for forecasts but show how the lack of policy action changed outcomes.

            Start with: "In an alternate timeline where the AI Congress recommendations
            were rejected..."

            ---

            ## Important Guidelines

            - Make the narrative vivid and engaging, like real journalism
            - Include specific dates, names of real world people where relevant
              (or fake names if they would not be known yet) and concrete details
            - If you make up any fake people or orgs, mark these with † and then explain this in the footnotes.
            - Show cause-and-effect relationships between policies and outcomes
            - Your own estimates marked with * should be plausible extrapolations
            - The tone should be neutral/journalistic, not promotional
            - Include both positive and negative consequences where realistic
            - Each forecast should be explicitly mentioned with its dice roll outcome
            - Ground speculation in research where possible
            - Use the aggregate policy as the source of truth for what policy is taken
            - You are writing for an audience that may not be familiar with the subject area.
              Make sure to include the events of the forecasts, but write in a way that they
              will understand as much as possible.

            ## Format

            Use markdown formatting with clear section headers. Aim for 1500-2500 words
            total across both parts.

            ## Categories to Cover

            Generate tweets in these categories:

            **THE GOOD** (2-3 tweets):
            - Surprising areas of consensus across different ideologies
            - Innovative ideas that emerged from the deliberation
            - Forecasts that challenge conventional wisdom

            **THE BAD** (2-3 tweets):
            - Concerning blind spots that multiple members missed
            - Problematic reasoning patterns you noticed
            - Important questions that weren't addressed

            **THE UGLY** (2-3 tweets):
            - Stark disagreements that reveal deep value differences
            - Uncomfortable tradeoffs that the analysis surfaced
            - Forecasts with wide uncertainty that matter a lot

            **THE INTERESTING** (2-3 tweets):
            - Unexpected forecasts or counter-intuitive findings
            - Surprising agreement between unlikely allies
            - Questions where the forecasts diverged most

            ## Tweet Guidelines

            Each tweet should:
            - Be self-contained and intriguing (people should want to click through)
            - Reference specific forecasts when relevant (e.g., "65% probability of X")
            - Attribute to the relevant congress member when applicable
            - Use hooks like "Surprising:" or "The [Member] vs [Member] split:"
            - Be under 280 characters
            - Not include hashtags

            Return a JSON list of strings, one per tweet.
