Phoneme export example using ttsforge.

This example demonstrates how to create a phoneme JSON file from text,
which can later be converted to audio. This is useful for:
- Pre-processing text for faster audio generation
- Inspecting and editing phonemes before synthesis
- Batch processing workflows

Uses the same punctuation-heavy text as punctuation.py to show
how punctuation affects phoneme generation.

Usage:
    python examples/phoneme_export.py

Output:
    punctuation_phonemes.json - Phoneme data in JSON format

To convert to audio later:
    ttsforge phonemes convert punctuation_phonemes.json -o punctuation_from_phonemes.wav

"Well," said the professor; "this is quite extraordinary!"

The experiment — which took years to complete — yielded surprising results:
success rates of 95%, 87%, and 72% (in that order).

"But wait..." she paused, "are you absolutely sure?"

Yes! No? Maybe... Who knows: life is full of mysteries;
that's what makes it interesting.

Consider this: the data shows (a) increased efficiency;
(b) reduced costs; and (c) improved outcomes — all remarkable achievements!

"To be, or not to be?" — that is the question.

He shouted: "Eureka!" Then whispered... "Finally."

The results were: excellent (A+), good (B), average (C);
however — and this is important — none failed!

"Why?" she asked. "Because," he replied, "science never sleeps..."
