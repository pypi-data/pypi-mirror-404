# Code Similarity (csim)

Code Similarity (csim) provide a module designed to detect similarities between source code files, even when obfuscation techniques have been applied. It is particularly useful for programming instructors and students who need to verify code originality.

## Key Features

- **Source Code Similarity Analysis:** Compares source code files to determine their degree of similarity.
- **Advanced Analysis:** Utilizes parse trees and the tree edit distance algorithm for in-depth analysis.
- **Parse Trees:** Represents the syntactic structure of source code, enabling detailed comparisons.
- **Tree Edit Distance:** Measures the similarity between different code structures.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core programming language for the tool.
- **ANTLR:** A parser generator for creating parse trees from source code.
- **zss:** A library for calculating the tree edit distance.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/EdsonEddy/csim.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd csim
    ```
3.  Install the package:
    ```sh
    pip install .
    ```

## Usage
csim can be used from the command line, for now only Python files are supported. In the future more languages will be added. For example, to compare two Python files, run:

```sh
csim -f file1.py file2.py
```

Alternatively, you can use csim as a Python module:
```python
from csim import Compare
code_a = "a = 5"
code_b = "c = 50"
similarity = Compare(code_a, code_b)
print(f"Similarity: {similarity}")
```

## ANTLR4 Instalation and Parser/Lexer Generation
This instalation is not required the files are already included in the project. But if you can review the steps to generate them yourself in the [grammars/README.md](grammars/parser_gen_guide.md) file.
