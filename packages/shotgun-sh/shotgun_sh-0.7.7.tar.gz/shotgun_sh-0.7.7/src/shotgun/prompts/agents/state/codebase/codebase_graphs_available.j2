## Codebase Graphs Available

{% if codebase_understanding_graphs -%}

You have access to the following codebase graphs:

{% for graph in codebase_understanding_graphs -%}
{% if indexing_graph_ids and graph.graph_id in indexing_graph_ids -%}
- {{ graph.name }} ID: {{ graph.graph_id }} Path: {{ graph.repo_path }} **[INDEXING - NOT AVAILABLE]**
{% else -%}
- {{ graph.name }} ID: {{ graph.graph_id }} Path: {{ graph.repo_path }}
{% endif -%}
{% endfor -%}

{% if indexing_graph_ids -%}

Note: Graphs marked [INDEXING - NOT AVAILABLE] are currently being built. Do not attempt to query these graphs until indexing is complete.
{% endif -%}

{% else -%}

{% if indexing_graph_ids -%}
A codebase is currently being indexed. This process can take a few minutes for large codebases. Once indexing completes, you will be able to query the code structure and answer questions about it.

Please ask the user to wait for indexing to finish before asking questions about the codebase.
{% elif is_tui_context -%}
No codebase has been indexed yet. To enable code analysis, please tell the user to restart the TUI and follow the prompt to 'Index this codebase?' when it appears.
{% else -%}
No codebase has been indexed yet. If the user needs code analysis, ask them to index a codebase first.
{% endif -%}
