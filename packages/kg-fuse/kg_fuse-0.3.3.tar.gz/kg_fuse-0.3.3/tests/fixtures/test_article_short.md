# Knowledge Graphs and Semantic Networks

Knowledge graphs represent information as interconnected entities and relationships. They enable semantic reasoning and discovery of implicit connections between concepts.

## Key Components

- **Nodes**: Represent entities or concepts
- **Edges**: Represent relationships between nodes
- **Properties**: Attributes attached to nodes and edges

## Applications

Knowledge graphs power search engines, recommendation systems, and AI assistants. They provide structured knowledge that enhances natural language understanding.
