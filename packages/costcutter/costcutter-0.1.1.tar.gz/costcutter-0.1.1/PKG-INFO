## 🎯 What is CostCutter?

CostCutter is a **serverless AWS cost protection system** that acts as an emergency brake for your cloud spending. It continuously monitors your AWS Budget and automatically triggers resource cleanup when costs exceed your predefined thresholds—ensuring you never wake up to a surprise $10,000 bill from a forgotten EC2 instance.

### Perfect for:
- 🎓 **Students** learning AWS who fear accidental charges
- 🧪 **Experimenters** testing AWS services without financial risk
- 🏖️ **Sandbox environments** that need automatic teardown
- 💡 **Side projects** with strict budget constraints
- 🚀 **Hackathons** where resources must be cleaned up after events

## ✨ Features

### 🎛️ **Powerful Control & Safety**

- **🏃 Dry Run Mode** - Test what would be deleted without actually deleting anything
- **🎯 Multi-Region Support** - Clean resources across all AWS regions or specific ones
- **⚙️ Flexible Configuration** - YAML-based config with environment variable overrides
- **📊 Detailed Reporting** - Live tables, summaries, and optional CSV exports
- **🔗 Dependency-Aware** - Handles resource dependencies in the correct order
- **🐍 Type-Safe** - Fully typed Python codebase with Pydantic validation

### 🚀 **Deployment Flexibility**

- **💻 CLI Mode** - Run manually from your terminal
- **☁️ Lambda Mode** - Deploy as serverless function triggered by AWS Budgets via SNS

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

Run CostCutter with uvx (no global install required):

```bash
# Run without installing (recommended)
uvx costcutter --version

# Safe dry run
uvx costcutter --dry-run
```

For full setup and configuration, see the documentation: https://costcutter.hyperoot.dev

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Dry run (safe mode - shows what would be deleted)
costcutter --dry-run

# Real execution (destructive!)
costcutter

# Use custom config
costcutter --config ./my-config.yaml
```

### Example Configuration

Create a `costcutter.yaml`:

```yaml
aws:
  region:
    - us-east-1
    - eu-west-1
  services:
    - ec2
    - s3
    - elasticbeanstalk

output:
  log_level: INFO
  report_format: csv
  report_path: ./cleanup-report.csv
```
