# tks-essentials
A library with essentials needed in every backend python app. e.g. logging, local db connection, filtering, formatting etc.

## Sponsors
Freya Alpha,
The Kára System,
Spark & Hale Robotic Industries

## General
Run and compiled for `Python 3.12.9`.
Expected to run for `Python 3+`.

## Development

### Testing
Run tests with `pytest -s -vv` to see all the details.

### Installation as Consuming Developer

Simply run: `pip install tks-essentials`

Import in modules without the dash (e.g.):
```python
from tksessentials import global_logger
```

### Setup as Contributor
Create the virtual environment:
```
py -m venv .venv
```
Start the environment:
```
./.venv/Scripts/activate
```
(or allow VS Code to start it). Use `deactivate` to stop it.

All the required libraries must be listed in `requirements.txt` and installed by
```
python -m pip install -r .\requirements.txt
```
For dev use:
```
python -m pip install -r .\requirements-dev.txt
```

To cleanup the environment run:
```
pip3 freeze > to-uninstall.txt
```
 and then
```
pip3 uninstall -y -r to-uninstall.txt
```

or 
```
pip3 install pip-autoremove
```

### Testing
Before running the tests, make sure that `utils.py` can find the root directory. Either set the
`PROJECT_ROOT` environment variable to the root directory, or create a `config` or `logs` directory
within the project root. Then run `pytest`.

### Build Library
Prerequisite: make sure that you give your Operating System user the right to modify files in the
`python` directory (where Python is installed). Use:
```
python setup.py bdist_wheel
```
to create the `dist`, `build`, and `.eggs` folders.
