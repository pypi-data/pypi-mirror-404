Dynamic: summary

LALSuite is the LIGO Scientific Collaboration Algorithm Library for
gravitational-wave analysis. Its primary purpose is searching for and
characterizing astrophysical signals in gravitational-wave time series data,
particularly data from ground-based detectors such as `LIGO
<https://www.ligo.org>`_ and `Virgo <http://www.virgo-gw.eu>`_.

LALSuite consists of a set of ``configure``-``make``-``install`` style software
packages organized by problem domain or source classification. This Python
package provides a standalone, dependency-free binary distribution of the
libraries and Python modules in LALSuite for Linux and macOS.

Installing LALSuite from the Python Package Index requires pip >= 19.3.

To install, simply run::

    $ pip install lalsuite

Optional dependencies, which can be installed as ``pip install lalsuite[option]``:

* ``lalinference`` (pulls in
  `gwdatafind <https://pypi.org/project/gwdatafind/>`_
  and `gwpy <https://pypi.org/project/gwpy/>`_)
* ``lalpulsar`` (pulls in
  `solar_system_ephemerides <https://pypi.org/project/solar-system-ephemerides/>`_
  to provide ephemeris files which, until LALSuite 7.15, were still included in
  the main package)
* ``test`` (pulls in `pytest <https://pypi.org/project/pytest/>`_)
