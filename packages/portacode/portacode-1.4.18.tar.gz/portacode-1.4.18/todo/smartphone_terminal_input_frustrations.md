# Terminal Input Frustrations on Smartphones

Managing terminal input via smartphone is very frustrating when writing long, detailed messages to AI CLIs like Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini CLI.

Key Pain Points:
- Tiny on-screen keyboard and limited editing capabilities
- Autocorrect/predictive text mangles code snippets
- No easy multi-line or block editing
- Cumbersome copy & paste of large blocks

This severely hampers productivity and accuracy when using CLI-based AI tools on mobile devices.
