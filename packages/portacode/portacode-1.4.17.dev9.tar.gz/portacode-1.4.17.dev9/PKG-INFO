```bash
portacode connect
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to:
- Visit [https://portacode.com](https://portacode.com)
- Create your free account
- Add your device using the generated key
- Start coding and administrating!

### 3. Access Your Development Environment

Once connected, you can:
- Open terminal sessions from the web dashboard

- Monitor system status
- Access your development environment from any device

Want to see Portacode running inside containers or powering classrooms? Browse the [`examples/` directory](https://github.com/portacode/portacode/tree/master/examples) (also bundled in the PyPI source) for copy-paste Docker Compose setups ranging from a single-device sandbox to a ten-seat workshop fleet.

## 🔑 Pair Devices with Zero-Touch Codes

The fastest way to bring a new machine online is with a short-lived pairing code:

1. Log in to [https://portacode.com](https://portacode.com) and press **Pair Device** on the dashboard:  
   ![Pair Device button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/portacode/portacode/master/docs/images/pair-device-button.png)
2. A four-digit code appears (valid for 15 minutes). This code only authorizes a pairing **request**—no device can reach your account until you approve it.
3. On the device, run Portacode with the code:
   ```bash
   PORTACODE_PAIRING_CODE=1234 portacode connect \
     --device-name "My Laptop" \
     --project-path /srv/project-one \
     --project-path /srv/project-two
   ```
   - `--device-name` (or `PORTACODE_DEVICE_NAME`) pre-fills the friendly label shown in the dashboard.
   - Repeat `--project-path /abs/path` to register up to ten Projects automatically once the request is approved.
   - Automating inside Docker? Export your own `PORTACODE_PROJECT_PATHS=/srv/a:/srv/b` and convert it into repeated `--project-path` switches before invoking the CLI—see `portacode_for_school/persistent_workspace/entrypoint.sh` for a reference implementation.
4. Because the device has no fingerprint yet, the CLI bootstraps an in-memory keypair and announces a pending request to the dashboard. You immediately see the card with the supplied metadata:  
   ![Pairing request card](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/portacode/portacode/master/docs/images/pairing-request.png)
5. Click **Approve**. The CLI persists the keypair on disk and transitions into a normal authenticated connection. Future `portacode connect` runs reuse the stored RSA keys—no additional codes required unless you revoke the device.

Need to pair multiple machines at once? A single pairing code can be reused concurrently: every device that launches `portacode connect` with that code shows up as its own approval card until you accept or decline it.

This workflow works great for headless setups and containers: export the environment variables, run `portacode connect --non-interactive`, and finish the approval from the dashboard.

## 💡 Use Cases

- **Remote Development**: Code, build, and debug from anywhere - even your phone
- **Server Administration**: 24/7 server access with persistent service installation
- **Mobile Development**: Full IDE experience on mobile devices

## 🔧 Essential Commands

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Start a connection (runs until closed)
portacode connect

# Run connection in background
portacode connect --detach

# Check version
portacode --version

# Get help
portacode --help
```

### Service Management
```bash
# First, authenticate your device
portacode connect

# For system services, install package system-wide
sudo pip install portacode --system

# Install persistent service (auto-start on boot)
sudo portacode service install

# Check service status (use -v for verbose debugging)
sudo portacode service status
sudo portacode service status -v

# Stop/remove the service
sudo portacode service stop
sudo portacode service uninstall
```

## 🌐 Web Dashboard

Access your connected devices at [https://portacode.com](https://portacode.com)

## 🔐 Security

- **RSA Key Authentication**: Each device gets a unique RSA key pair
- **HTTPS Encrypted**: All communication is encrypted in transit
- **No Passwords**: Key-based authentication eliminates password risks
- **Revocable Access**: Remove devices instantly from the web dashboard
- **Local Key Storage**: Private keys never leave your device

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
```bash
# Check if another connection is running
portacode connect

# View service logs
sudo portacode service status --verbose
```

### Service Installation Issues
```bash
# First authenticate your device
portacode connect

# If service commands fail, ensure system-wide installation
sudo pip install portacode --system

# Then try service installation again
sudo portacode service install

# Use verbose status to debug connection issues
sudo portacode service status -v
```

### Clipboard Issues (Linux)
```bash
# Install clipboard support
sudo apt-get install xclip
```

### Key Management
Portacode follows the OS-specific *user data* directory (via [`platformdirs`](https://pypi.org/project/platformdirs/)) and keeps its identity in `portacode/keys/`:
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/portacode/keys/`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/portacode/keys/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\portacode\keys\`

When `PORTACODE_PAIRING_CODE` is set, the CLI generates an in-memory keypair, waits for dashboard approval, and only then writes the files to this directory. If that folder disappears, the CLI will create a fresh identity next time it runs.

#### Persisting Keys in Containers
Docker images (including the simple `python:3.11-slim` example that runs Portacode as `root`) store the data inside `/root/.local/share/portacode`. Bind-mount that path or override `XDG_DATA_HOME` so the keys survive container restarts:

```yaml
services:
  device-01:
    build: .
    environment:
      PORTACODE_PAIRING_CODE: "${PORTACODE_PAIRING_CODE:-}"
    volumes:
      - ./data/device-01/workspace:/root/workspace
      - ./data/device-01/.local/share/portacode:/root/.local/share/portacode  # persists device keys
```

Alternatively, set `XDG_DATA_HOME=/root/.portacode` before running `portacode connect` and mount that directory from the host. The rule of thumb: **persist whichever folder contains `.local/share/portacode/keys/`** so your device fingerprint sticks around.

#### Minimal Docker Example
If you want a plug-and-play container, check the `examples/simple_device/` folder that ships with this repo and the PyPI source distribution. It contains a tiny `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml` you can copy as-is. The Dockerfile installs `git` before `pip install portacode` so GitPython can interact with repositories—remember to do the same in your own images if you expect to work inside version-controlled projects.

The accompanying Compose file demonstrates how to:
- run `portacode connect --non-interactive` with a predefined `--device-name` and `--project-path`
- pass `PORTACODE_PAIRING_CODE` via environment variables
- bind-mount your workspace plus `/root/.local/share/portacode` for key persistence

Together, those 10 lines illustrate the complete flow for remotely accessing a Docker-hosted machine with Portacode.

#### Workshop Fleet Example
Training a group? `examples/workshop_fleet/` spins up ten identical containers—one per student—with their own workspace bind mounts plus a shared read-only `instructions/` folder. The Dockerfile in that folder copies everything from `initial_content/` into the image (`COPY initial_content/ /opt/initial_content/`), and the compose command seeds each student workspace on boot via `cp -an /opt/initial_content/. /root/workspace/`. That means:
- Instructors drop starter code into `initial_content/` before `docker compose up` and every container gets the same seed files without overwriting student changes after the first sync.
- The host `instructions/` directory is mounted at `/root/workspace/instructions` in **read-only** mode, so you can update agendas or hints live while students can only view them.
- Each seat persists its Portacode identity in `data/student-XX/.local/share/portacode`, so reconnecting after a restart does not need new pairing codes.

See the full walkthrough and assets in [`examples/workshop_fleet/`](https://github.com/portacode/portacode/tree/master/examples/workshop_fleet), which is also shipped inside the PyPI source tarball for offline access.
