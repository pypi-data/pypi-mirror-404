# Infiniloom

**AST-aware code context engine for RAG, vector databases, and AI code assistants**

A high-performance Rust library and CLI for generating intelligent code context for LLMs. Uses Tree-sitter AST parsing (22 languages), PageRank symbol ranking, and BLAKE3 content-addressable hashing. Integrates with Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, ChromaDB, and any vector database. Optimized for Claude, GPT-5, GPT-4o, Gemini, Llama, and 27+ LLM tokenizers.

## The Problem

When you ask an AI to help with code, quality depends almost entirely on what context you provide. Most approaches fail:

- **Pasting random files** gives the AI fragments without structure or relationships
- **Dumping entire repositories** overwhelms the AI with noise and irrelevant code
- **Token limits** force you to leave out important context, leading to incorrect suggestions
- **AI doesn't know what it doesn't know** — it can't ask for the files it needs
- **Copy-paste workflows** are slow, error-prone, and don't scale
- **Every question requires re-gathering context** from scratch

The result: AI gives generic answers, hallucinates function signatures, or misses critical dependencies — not because the AI is bad, but because the context is bad.

## What Infiniloom Does

Infiniloom reads your codebase and produces a structured summary designed specifically for AI consumption.

Think of it like this: instead of handing someone a filing cabinet and saying "figure it out," you give them a well-organized briefing document that highlights what matters.

Here's how it works:

1. **Analyzes structure** — Infiniloom understands how your code is organized: which files exist, how they relate, what languages are used.

2. **Extracts meaning** — It identifies the important pieces: functions, classes, interfaces, types. Not just text, but semantic units that AI can reason about.

3. **Ranks importance** — Using techniques similar to how search engines rank web pages, it determines which code is central to your project and which is peripheral.

4. **Filters noise** — Generated files, build artifacts, vendored dependencies, and other distractions are automatically excluded.

5. **Formats for AI** — The output is structured in ways that different AI models understand best — XML for Claude, Markdown for GPT-4o/GPT-5, YAML for Gemini.

The result is a context package that helps AI give you accurate, relevant answers about your actual code.

## What You Can Do With It

### For Developers

- **AI-assisted code review** — Give your AI the context to understand what a pull request actually changes
- **Ask architectural questions** — "How does authentication flow through this system?"
- **Generate documentation** — Let AI explain your code with full visibility into dependencies
- **Onboard faster** — Understand a new codebase in hours instead of weeks
- **Debug complex issues** — Provide AI with the relevant code paths, not just the error message

### For AI / RAG / Agents

- **Build better context** — Prepare high-quality input for LLM applications
- **Reduce token usage** — Send what matters, not everything
- **Improve answer accuracy** — Relevant context produces relevant answers
- **Enable code-aware agents** — Give autonomous systems the context they need to act correctly

## For RAG & Vector Databases

Infiniloom's `embed` command generates deterministic, content-addressable code chunks designed specifically for retrieval-augmented generation:

```bash
# Generate chunks for your vector database
infiniloom embed ./my-repo -o chunks.jsonl

# Only get changed chunks (incremental updates)
infiniloom embed ./my-repo --diff -o updates.jsonl
```

### Key Features for RAG

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Content-Addressable IDs** | Same code anywhere produces same ID (`ec_a1b2c3d4...`) — enables cross-repo deduplication |
| **AST-Aware Chunking** | Never splits mid-function or mid-class — preserves semantic boundaries |
| **Incremental Updates** | Manifest-based diffing detects added/modified/removed chunks — only re-embed what changed |
| **Hierarchical Chunks** | Parent-child relationships preserved — container summaries link to member chunks |
| **Auto-Generated Tags** | Semantic tags (`async`, `security`, `database`, `http`) improve retrieval relevance |
| **Call Graph Context** | `calls` and `called_by` fields enable dependency-aware retrieval |

### Vector Database Integration

Works with any vector database that accepts JSON/JSONL:

```bash
# Pinecone / Weaviate / Qdrant
infiniloom embed . --max-tokens 1500 -o chunks.jsonl
# Import chunks.jsonl using your vector DB's bulk import

# ChromaDB / pgvector / Milvus
infiniloom embed . --format json -o chunks.json
# Parse JSON array and insert with your preferred client
```

### Chunk Output Format

Each chunk includes rich metadata for filtering and retrieval:

```json
{
  "id": "ec_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8",
  "content": "async fn authenticate(token: &str) -> Result<User, AuthError> {...}",
  "tokens": 245,
  "kind": "function",
  "source": {
    "file": "src/auth.rs",
    "symbol": "authenticate",
    "fqn": "src::auth::authenticate",
    "language": "Rust"
  },
  "context": {
    "docstring": "Validates JWT token and returns authenticated user",
    "calls": ["verify_jwt", "find_user_by_id"],
    "called_by": ["login_handler", "refresh_token"],
    "tags": ["async", "security", "public-api"]
  }
}
```

See the [embed command documentation](docs/commands/embed.md) for complete details.

## Quick Start

**Install:**

```bash
npm install -g infiniloom
```

**Generate context for your repository:**

```bash
infiniloom pack . --output context.xml
```

This produces an XML file containing your codebase's structure, key symbols, and content — ready to paste into Claude, GPT, or any other AI assistant.

## How This Is Different

**Compared to "just paste the code":**

Infiniloom understands code structure. It knows the difference between a core business function and a utility helper. It understands imports, dependencies, and relationships. Pasting files gives AI text; Infiniloom gives AI understanding.

**Compared to generic RAG tools:**

Most RAG systems treat code as documents. They chunk by character count, embed text, and retrieve by similarity. This misses the structure that makes code meaningful. Infiniloom preserves semantic boundaries — functions stay whole, relationships stay intact.

**Compared to embedding-based approaches:**

Embeddings are useful for "find code similar to X." They're less useful for "understand how X works." Infiniloom focuses on comprehension: what exists, how it connects, what matters. This is about building complete context, not searching fragments.

**Our philosophy:**

Context quality beats context quantity. A smaller, well-structured context produces better AI responses than a larger, noisier one. Infiniloom prioritizes signal over volume.

---

## Who This Is For

**Good fit:**

- Developers using AI assistants for code review, debugging, or documentation
- Teams building AI-powered developer tools or code analysis products
- Engineers working with large or unfamiliar codebases
- Anyone who needs AI to understand real production code, not toy examples

**Probably not needed:**

- Single-file scripts or small utilities (just paste them directly)
- Projects where you already have perfect context (rare, but possible)
- Use cases where code search is more important than code comprehension

---

## Project Status
