Network Simplex - simplex specialized for flow networks.

Remember simplex walking along edges of a crystal? Network simplex does the
same thing, but the crystal has special structure: it's a flow network. Instead
of a dense tableau, it maintains a spanning tree. Pivots become tree edge swaps.
This structure makes it fly on large networks where regular simplex would struggle.

    from solvor.network_simplex import network_simplex

    result = network_simplex(n_nodes, arcs, supplies)

    Source [+10] --(cap:10, cost:2)--> [0] Transship --(cap:15, cost:1)--> [-10] Sink
                  \__(cap:5, cost:3)_____________________/

How it works: maintain a spanning tree basis. Each iteration, find an arc with
negative reduced cost (entering), trace the cycle it creates, find the
bottleneck (leaving), and update flows and potentials. Much faster than dense
simplex for sparse networks.

Use this for:

- Large-scale min-cost flow problems
- Transportation and transshipment networks
- When min_cost_flow is too slow

Parameters:

    n_nodes: number of nodes
    arcs: list of (from, to, capacity, cost) tuples
    supplies: positive = produces flow, negative = consumes, zero = transship

Don't use this for: problems that aren't min-cost flow shaped (use solve_lp),
or tiny problems where config overhead isn't worth it (use min_cost_flow).
