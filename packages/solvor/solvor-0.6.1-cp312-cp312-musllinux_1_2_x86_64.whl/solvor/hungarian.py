Hungarian Algorithm for optimal assignment.

Got workers and tasks? This finds who does what at minimum total cost. O(n³),
the go-to for pure assignment problems.

    from solvor import solve_hungarian

    result = solve_hungarian(cost_matrix)
    result = solve_hungarian(cost_matrix, minimize=False)  # maximize

             Task A  Task B  Task C
    Worker 0   10      5      13        solve_hungarian finds: 0→B, 1→A, 2→C
    Worker 1    3      9      18        total cost: 5 + 3 + 12 = 20
    Worker 2   10      6      12

How it works: repeatedly modify the cost matrix by subtracting row/column
minimums and adjusting potentials until an optimal assignment can be read
directly from the zeros. Uses dual variables (potentials) to maintain
optimality conditions throughout.

Use this for:

- Worker-to-task assignment
- Resource allocation problems
- One-to-one matching with costs

Parameters:

    cost_matrix: rows are workers, columns are tasks
    minimize: if True minimize total cost, else maximize

Returns assignment[i] = column assigned to row i. Rectangular matrices work
fine, assigns min(rows, cols) pairs.

Don't use this for: matching within a single group (roommates, tennis doubles),
or when one worker handles multiple tasks / one task needs multiple workers
(use min_cost_flow).
