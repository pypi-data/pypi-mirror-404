Network Flow, for assignment, matching, and bottleneck analysis.

Use max_flow when you need "how much can I push through this network?"
Use min_cost_flow when cost matters: "what's the cheapest way to route X units?"

    from solvor.flow import max_flow, min_cost_flow

    # graph: {node: [(neighbor, capacity, cost), ...]}
    result = max_flow(graph, source='s', sink='t')
    result = min_cost_flow(graph, source='s', sink='t', demand=10)

How it works: max_flow uses Ford-Fulkerson with BFS (Edmonds-Karp), repeatedly
finding augmenting paths until none exist. min_cost_flow uses successive
shortest paths via Bellman-Ford, finding the cheapest augmenting path each time.
The max-flow min-cut theorem means you find bottlenecks for free.

Use this for:

- Assignment and matching problems
- Server-to-request allocation
- Transportation and logistics
- Finding network bottlenecks (max-flow = min-cut)

Parameters:

    graph: adjacency dict {node: [(neighbor, capacity, cost), ...]}
    source: source node
    sink: sink node
    demand: (min_cost_flow only) units to route

Works well with NetworkX for graph construction. For heavier graph work
(shortest paths, centrality, community detection), NetworkX is more extensive.
