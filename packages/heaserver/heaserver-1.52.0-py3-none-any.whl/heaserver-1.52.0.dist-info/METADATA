# HEA Server Framework
[Research Informatics Shared Resource](https://risr.hci.utah.edu), [Huntsman Cancer Institute](https://healthcare.utah.edu/huntsmancancerinstitute/), Salt Lake City, UT

The HEA Server Framework contains shared code for creating HEA microservices.


## Version 1.52.0
* Added more sorting capabilities to heaserver.service.aiohttp.
* Added a list_with_capacity function to heaserver.service.util.

## Version 1.51.0
* Added simulate_permissions attribute to heaserver.service.aws.AWSPermissionContext to override the default
  behavior regarding whether to consult AWS SimulatePrincipalPolicy when checking permissions of an AWS object. As part
  of this work, S3ObjectPermissionContext's check_attribute_permissions attribute was removed, as it effectively did
  the same thing as simulate_permissions.
* The display_name of AWS accounts is now "AWS {account_id}" not "AWS Account {account_id}".

## Version 1.50.0
* Fixed error when logging namedtuples and NamedTuples with the scrubber.
* We no longer use AWS SimulatePrincipalPolicy because it's too slow. The code is still there in case we want it for
  something in the future.

## Version 1.49.0
* Added heaserver.service.util.format_sequence function.
* Added post_desktop_object and post_desktop_object_return_id to heaserver.service.db.mongoservicelib.
* Removed heaserver.service.db.awsservicelib.get_volume_id_for_account_id.
* Don't close boto3 clients because it closes ALL underlying connections not just the one in use.
* Improved performance getting account information.

## Version 1.48.0
* heaserver.service.crypt.SecretDecryption has a new property, encrypted_config_property_prefix, and a new method,
  is_config_property_encrypted.
* Expand a tilde in heaserver.service.config.Configuration's encryption_key_file attribute for Windows compatibility.
* Check if key file exists or try using the HEA_ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable in
  heaserver.service.config.Configuration.get_attribute_encryption_key method.
* Bumped heaobject version to 1.36.0.

## Version 1.47.2
* Restored backward compatibility with the older HEA_ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable. The file-based approach
  for accessing the encryption key is preferred when both are available.

## Version 1.47.1
* wait_on_coro_cleanup_ctx no longer aborts if there is failed task executed.

## Version 1.47.0
* We now pass a heaserver.service.config.Configuration object into the Database classes instead of a ConfigParser.
* Added support for encrypted Mongo and RabbitMQ passwords.
* Added HEA_ATTRIBUTE_ENCRYPTION_KEY request property and HEA_ATTRIBUTE_ENCRYPTION_KEY_GETTER app property. They're
  populated automatically.
* Added heaserver.service.crypt module to support encrypting/decrypting attribute values and decrypting config
  properties.
* Added convenience methods to heaserver.service.config.Configuration to handle encrypted properties.
* Added new EncryptionKeyFile default config property.

## Version 1.46.0
* heaserver.service.db.mongoservicelib.post_dict_return_id now checks the requested type.
* Encrypt attributes marked with needs_encryption metadata when writing to Mongo, and decrypt when reading from Mongo.
* Added support for HEA_DECRYPTION_KEY application property, which contains the key for encrypting and decrypting.
* Constrained pycares dependency to version <5.0.0 because our version of aiodns doesn't work with pycares 5.
* Bumped heaobject version to 1.35.0.

## Version 1.45.1

## Version 1.44.1
* Added more third-party libraries to the logging configuration.
* Scrub URL access_token query parameter value.
* Added OIDC claim header constants and marked them as sensitive in the logging module.
* The logging module now scrubs arguments that are sequences of mappings.

## Version 1.44.0
* Implemented log filtering by default, if no logging configuration file is provided as a command line argument.
* Don't suppress CancelledError exceptions when a background task is cancelled.
* Don't initialize the logger when importing a module, or logging configuration might be skipped.
* Bumped heaobject version to 1.34.0.
* New optional -e/--env command-line argument for setting the runtime environment (development, staging, or
  production). Logging is now configured based on this setting, unless the older -l/--logging argument is provided. The
  default value is development.

## Version 1.43.3
* Log a stack trace when a background task raises an exception.

## Version 1.43.2

## Version 1.40.0
* Fixed bug in AWS permissions simulation boto3 API usage.
* Support the s3:DeleteObjectVersion action while simulating permissions.
* Added has_read_only_permission, has_editor_permission, has_deleter_permission, and has_sharer_permission
  functions to supported action itemif functions.
* Finally fixed the MaybeDockerNotRunning exception not getting raised reliably.
* Documented hea-deleter rel value.

  Collection+JSON templates.

## Version 1.36.2
* Bumped heaobject version to 1.27.1.

## Version 1.36.1
* Bumped heaobject version to 1.27.0.

* Replaced dict with heaserver.service.db.mongoservicelib.SortDict more places.
* Fixed heaserver.service.db.mongoservicelib.MongoSortOrder.from_request type hint and related documentation. The type
  hint and documentation said it could return None, and it couldn't.
* Removed heaserver.service.db.mongoservicelib.extract_sort_dict, as it duplicated a MongoSortOrder method.

## Version 1.34.0

  parameter.
* Renamed heaserver.service.db.awsservicelib.s3_object_display_name to s3_object_message_display_name.
* Added as_sort_order, from_sort_order, from_request, and from_request_dict methods to
  heaserver.service.db.mongoservicelib.MongoSortOrder. Removed
  heaserver.service.db.mongoservicelib.parse_sort_query_param, which was replaced by
  MongoSortOrder.from_request and better complies with how sort query parameters are supposed to work.

## Version 1.33.1
* Bumped heaobject version to 1.26.3.

## Version 1.33.0
* Worked around aiodiskqueue bug preventing loading of previously persisted messages.
* Added heaserver.service.db.aws.CLIENT_ERROR_BUCKET_NOT_EMPTY boto3 error code constant, and the
  heaserver.service.db.aws.client_error_status function maps it to the 400 status code.

## Version 1.32.2

## Version 1.31.0
* Bumped heaobject version to 1.24.0.
* Made more complete use of the heaserver.service.wstl.WeSTLactionType typed dict. The argument to
  heaserver.service.wstl.RuntimeWeSTLDocumentBuilder.add_design_time_action is now a WeSTLctionType instead of a
  generic dict. Similarly, RuntimeWeSTLDocumentBuilder.find_action now returns a WeSTLactionType or None instead of a
  generic dict or None.
* Added hea property to WeSTLactionType.
* In the heaserver.service.db.mongoservicelib module, get_dict, get_desktop_object, get_by_name_dict,
  get_all_desktop_objects, and get_all_desktop_objects_gen now all have permission context and mongo parameters to
  facilitate reuse. There are also new functions to make working with requests for ascending/descending order easier to
  handle.
* Also in the heaserver.service.db.mongoservicelib module, a bug was fixed causing permissions not to be included in
  the HTTP response when the desktop objects were retrieved from the cache.

## Version 1.30.2
* Fixed heaserver.service.wstl.WeSTLactionType target type.
* Use heaserver.service.wstl.WeSTLactionType everywhere it should be.
* Ensure cached get-all requests return the objects' permissions.

## Version 1.30.1
* Bumped heaobject version to 1.23.0.

## Version 1.30.0

* Added new method to the heaobject.service.db.database.Database class, get_default_permission_context.
* Changed heaserver.service.db.mongo.Mongo class methods to accept a PermissionContext instead of a sub.
* Made similar changes to the heaserver.service.testcase.mockmongo.MockMongo class.
* Changed heaobject.service.db.mongoservicelib to use the get_default_permission_context method above to pass a context
  into heaobject.service.db.mongo.Mongo objects.

* Changed heaserver.service.db.mongoexpr.sub_filter_expr to accept just permissions and context parameters, and
  altered its implementation to use the heaobject.root.DesktopObject's new dynamic_permission_supported and
  super_admin_default_permissions attributes.
* Removed a redundant EnumWithAttrs class from the heaserver.service.heaobjectsupport module. Instead, that module now
  imports an identical class from the heaobject library.
* Implemented in operator support for heaserver.service.heaobjectsupport.RESTPermissionGroup.

* heaserver.service.db.aws.AWSPermissionContext and S3ObjectPermissionContext are no longer generic.
* New heaserver.service.db.aws.AWSDesktopObjectTypeVar_cov covariant version of the AWSDesktopObjectTypeVar type.
* New heaserver.service.db.Database.get_default_permission_context method.
* Made return types of heaserver.service.db.DatabaseManager subclass methods more specific.
* The subclasses of heaobject.root.PermissionContext now accept any DesktopObject and appropriately delegate to the
  superclass.

## Version 1.27.4
* Bumped heaobject version to 1.20.2.

## Version 1.27.3
* Fixed Queue.task_done() was never awaited bug.

## Version 1.27.2

  the datetime of the server running HEA.

## Version 1.27.0
* Added heaserver.service.db.aws.get_default_share() function to get a share object assuming no information about what
  AWS permissions the user has for a desktop object.
* Added heaserver.service.db.aws.add_default_share_to_desktop_object() function, which adds the share created by
  get_default_share() above if the requesting user is not system|none.

* Opted for more stable pagination approach for search results coming from OpenSearch.

## Version 1.26.0

  the volume_id from the HTTP request.

## Version 1.25.1
* Now depends on heaobject 1.20.0 with no breaking changes.

## Version 1.25.0
* Now depends on heaobject 1.19.0.

## Version 1.23.0
* Added optional failed_cb keyword argument to heaserver.service.messagebroker.publisher_cleanup_context_factory that
  is called when something goes wrong with the connection to RabbitMQ.
* Events that cannot be published to the message broker are now persisted in a queue backed by sqlite and retried later
  if the PublishQueuePersistencePath config property is set. If not set, the queue is in-memory only.

  organization and account are created and linked automatically.
* Support substituting request header values in link URLs.
* Address potential resource leaks.
* Lots of doc string enhancements.
* New heaserver.service.util function, filter_mapping, which is useful for creating header mappings from request

* Fixed retry and async_retry to raise the actual exception rather than RetryExhaustedError.
* Removed RetryExhaustedError.
* Altered the Mongo context manager not to close the client in __aexit__().
* Don't let freezegun prevent asyncio.sleep() from working.
* The Collection+JSON representor can now be configured to omit data and permissions and just return links.

## Version 1.15.1

to prevent errors with recent pytest versions. The class was previously documented as abstract but did not inherit from
abc.ABC nor did it have any methods marked as abstract.
* Updated dependencies.

## Version 1.12.1

* Added optional desktop object parameter to heaserver.service.db.mongoservicelib.put.
* Addressed minor bugs in the testing framework.
* The heaserver.service.db.database.DatabaseContextManager.credentials property now does a deep copy of the credential list before returning it.
* Altered parameter validation of heaserver.service.db.aws.S3.get_client() so that the credentials and volume_id parameters can both be None (which delegates credentials to the boto3 library).

and http_error_message in heaserver.service.aiohttp).

## Version 1.10.7
* Updated pymongo dependency

## Version 1.10.6
* Addressed potential interpreter hang at the end of running tests.

## Version 1.10.5
* Fixed bug sometimes preventing role from being assumed.

## Version 1.10.4
* Improved performance generating cloud credentials.

* Make mongo insert calls return HTTP Conflict status code when appropriate.
* Resolved a potential issue getting an AWS account.

## Version 1.10.2
* Adds email util

## Version 1.10.1
* Limit the duration of privilege elevation when requesting it from AWS.

## Version 1.10.0
* Added elevate_privileges method to heaserver.service.db.S3.

## Version 1.9.0
* Fixed type hints, requiring mostly minor API changes.

## Version 1.8.3
* Fixed error getting object versions if no prefix is specified.

## Version 1.8.2
* Retry getting temporary credentials when the call to boto3 assume_role_with_web_identity fails.
* Use boto3's built-in paginator everywhere.

## Version 1.8.1
* Prevent failed content downloads from hanging the microservice.

## Version 1.8.0
* Moved CLIENT_ERROR* constants from heaserver.service.db.awsservicelib to the aws module.
* Updated the logic for determining permissions for AWS accounts, buckets, and objects to fallback to full permissions if the user lacks permission in AWS to simulate permissions. Thus, the behavior will fall back to that of version 1.6 or earlier. As before, AWS will still reject requests that the user lacks permissions for. A future version of heaserver will likely attempt to use elevated permissions to perform the simulation.

## Version 1.7.1
* Fixed the order in which multiple exceptions are raised.

## Version 1.7.0
* requirements_dev.txt now sets a minimum version of setuptools to address a security vulnerability. Also updated to a newer version of build.

## Configuration
The `heaserver.service.messagebroker` module supports publishing and receiving messages to/from a RabbitMQ message
broker. A `HEASERVER_MESSAGE_BROKER_QUEUE_PATH` environment variable is supported that, if set with the path to a
sqlite database, will cause message broker messages that fail to publish to be persisted and retried later. If not set,
failed messages will be stored only in memory and thus lost if the microservice is restarted. The variable need not be
set for microservices that do not publish to the message broker. The same file must not be shared across multiple
microservices or data corruption may result.

## Development environment

### Build requirements
* Any development environment is fine.
* On Windows, you also will need:
    * Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019, found at https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/. Select the C++ tools.
    * git, found at https://git-scm.com/download/win.
* On Mac, Xcode or the command line developer tools is required, found in the Apple Store app.
* Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12: Download and install Python from https://www.python.org, and select the options to install
for all users and add Python to your environment variables. The install for all users option will help keep you from
accidentally installing packages into your Python installation's site-packages directory instead of to your virtualenv
environment, described below.
* Create a virtualenv environment using the `python -m venv <venv_directory>` command, substituting `<venv_directory>`
with the directory name of your virtual environment. Run `source <venv_directory>/bin/activate` (or `<venv_directory>/Scripts/activate` on Windows) to activate the virtual
environment. You will need to activate the virtualenv every time before starting work, or your IDE may be able to do
this for you automatically. **Note that PyCharm will do this for you, but you have to create a new Terminal panel
after you newly configure a project with your virtualenv.**
* From the project's root directory, and using the activated virtualenv, run `pip install wheel` followed by
  `pip install -r requirements_dev.txt`. **Do NOT run `python setup.py develop`. It will break your environment.**

### Running tests
Run tests with the `pytest` command from the project root directory. To improve performance, run tests in multiple
processes with `pytest -n auto`.

### Running integration tests
* Install Docker

### Packaging and releasing this project
See the [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) file for details.
