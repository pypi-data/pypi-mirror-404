### Architecture Layers

- **CLI Layer**: User-facing commands, delegates to use cases
- **Use Case Layer**: Orchestrates business logic, coordinates services and domain services
- **Domain Layer**: Business entities and domain services for persistence logic
- **Service Layer**: Pure executors (no repository access), focused on single responsibilities
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Storage adapters, external system integrations
- **Repository Layer**: Data access abstraction
```

## Installation

### Homebrew (Recommended - No pip/venv needed!)

**Install with Homebrew - handles everything automatically:**

```bash
brew install --build-from-source https://raw.githubusercontent.com/galenspikes/spatelier/main/Formula/spatelier.rb
