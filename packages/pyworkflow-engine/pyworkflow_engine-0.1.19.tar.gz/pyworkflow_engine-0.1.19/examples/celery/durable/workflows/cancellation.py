Celery Durable Workflow - Cancellation

This example demonstrates graceful workflow cancellation with Celery:
- Cancel running or suspended workflows via CLI
- Handle CancellationError for cleanup
- Use shield() to protect critical operations

================================================================================
PREREQUISITES
================================================================================

1. Start Redis:
   docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine

2. Start the Celery worker (in a separate terminal):
   pyworkflow --module examples.celery.durable.08_cancellation worker run

================================================================================
HOW TO RUN AND CANCEL
================================================================================

STEP 1: Start the workflow (it will sleep for 60 seconds):

   pyworkflow --module examples.celery.durable.08_cancellation workflows run \
       cancellable_order_workflow --arg order_id=order-123

   Output: Workflow started: run_abc123def456...

STEP 2: Check the status (should be "suspended" during sleep):

   pyworkflow runs status <run_id>
   pyworkflow runs list --status suspended

STEP 3: Cancel the workflow while it's sleeping:

   pyworkflow runs cancel <run_id> --reason "Customer cancelled"

   Or wait for cancellation to complete:

   pyworkflow runs cancel <run_id> --wait --reason "Customer cancelled"

STEP 4: Check the worker logs - you should see:
   - [Workflow] Cancellation detected!
   - [Cleanup] Releasing inventory...
   - [Cleanup] Refunding payment...

STEP 5: Verify the final status:

   pyworkflow runs status <run_id>
   pyworkflow runs logs <run_id> --filter cancel

================================================================================
KEY POINTS
================================================================================

- Cancellation is CHECKPOINT-BASED: happens before steps, during sleep/hook
- If a step is already running, cancellation waits until it completes
- Use shield() to protect cleanup code from cancellation
- Catch CancellationError to perform compensation logic
