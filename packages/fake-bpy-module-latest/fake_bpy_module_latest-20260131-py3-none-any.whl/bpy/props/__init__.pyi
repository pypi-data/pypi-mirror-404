"""
This module defines properties to extend Blender's internal data. The result of these functions is used to assign properties to classes registered with Blender and can't be used directly.

[NOTE]
All parameters to these functions must be passed as keywords.


--------------------

Custom properties can be added to any subclass of an ID,
Bone and PoseBone.

These properties can be animated, accessed by the user interface and Python
like Blender's existing properties.

[WARNING]
Access to these properties might happen in threaded context, on a per-data-block level.
This has to be carefully considered when using accessors or update callbacks.
Typically, these callbacks should not affect any other data that the one owned by their data-block.
When accessing external non-Blender data, thread safety mechanisms should be considered.

```../examples/bpy.props.py```


--------------------

A common use of custom properties is for Python based Operator
classes. Test this code by running it in the text editor, or by clicking the
button in the 3D View-port's Tools panel. The latter will show the properties
in the Redo panel and allow you to change them.

```../examples/bpy.props.1.py```


--------------------

PropertyGroups can be used for collecting custom settings into one value
to avoid many individual settings mixed in together.

```../examples/bpy.props.2.py```


--------------------

Custom properties can be added to any subclass of an ID,
Bone and PoseBone.

```../examples/bpy.props.3.py```


--------------------

It can be useful to perform an action when a property is changed and can be
used to update other properties or synchronize with external data.

All properties define update functions except for CollectionProperty.

[WARNING]
Remember that these callbacks may be executed in threaded context.

[WARNING]
If the property belongs to an Operator, the update callback's first
parameter will be an OperatorProperties instance, rather than an instance
of the operator itself. This means you can't access other internal functions
of the operator, only its other properties.

```../examples/bpy.props.4.py```


--------------------

Accessor functions can be used for boolean, int, float, string and enum properties.

If get

 or set

 callbacks are defined, the property will not be stored in the ID properties
automatically. Instead, the get

 and set

 functions will be called when the property
is respectively read or written from the API, and are responsible to handle the data storage.

Note that:

* It is illegal to define a set

 callback without a matching get

 one.
* When a get

 callback is defined but no set

 one, the property is read-only.

get_transform

 and set_transform

 can be used when the returned value needs to be modified,
but the default internal storage is still used. They can only transform the value before it is
set or returned, but do not control how/where that data is stored.

[NOTE]
It is possible to define both get

/set

 and get_transform

/set_transform

 callbacks
for a same property. In practice however, this should rarely be needed, as most 'transform'
operation can also happen within a get

/set

 callback.

[WARNING]
Remember that these callbacks may be executed in threaded context.

[WARNING]
Take care when accessing other properties in these callbacks, as it can easily trigger
complex issues, such as infinite loops (if e.g. two properties try to also set the other
property's value in their own set

 callback), or unexpected side effects due to changes
in data, caused e.g. by an update

 callback.

```../examples/bpy.props.5.py```

[NOTE]
Pointer properties do not support storing references to embedded IDs (e.g. bpy.types.Scene.collection, bpy.types.Material.node_tree).
These should exclusively be referenced and accessed through their owner ID (e.g. the scene or material).
