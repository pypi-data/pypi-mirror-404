# Monoco Manifesto: Agent-Native Development

## The Challenge

Modern software development is becoming complex for humans to manage alone. AI Agents are here to help, but they are often treated as "fast typing humans" rather than true autonomous collaborators.

## Our Philosophy: Agent-Native

We believe tooling should be **Agent-Native**. This means:

1. **Determinism over Ambiguity**: Interfaces should favor structured outputs and clear state management.
2. **Context as Code**: The project state (issues, decisions, research) should live in the repository, making it as accessible to agents as the source code itself.
3. **Seamless Cooperation**: Humans provide strategy; Agents handle operations.

## Monoco Toolkit

Monoco is our implementation of these principles. It provides:

- **Git-Native Issue Tracking**: Humans use a familiar UI; Agents use a structured CLI.
- **Universal Atoms**: Every task is an atom of delivery, tracked from design to deployment.
- **Built for Speed**: No heavy infrastructure. Just Git, Markdown, and Python.

Join us in building the future of autonomous development.
