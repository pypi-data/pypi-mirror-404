# Release Security Audit Report

**Date:** 2026-01-13
**Auditor:** Monoco Agent

## Summary

A security audit was performed on the Toolkit codebase in preparation for the GitHub release.

## Scope

- Source code directory (`monoco/`)
- Test directory (`tests/`)
- Configuration files (`.monoco/config.yaml`, `.monoco/`)
- Gitignore rules

## Findings

1.  **Secrets Scanning**:
    - Scanned for keywords: `password`, `secret`, `token`, `api_key`.
    - **Result**: No hardcoded secrets found in tracked files.

2.  **Configuration**:
    - `.env` is correctly added to `.gitignore`.
    - `local_config.yaml` is correctly added to `.gitignore`.
    - Default configuration in `monoco/core/config.py` contains no sensitive defaults.

3.  **Test Data**:
    - Test fixtures in `tests/conftest.py` and `tests/daemon/` use generated or mock data.
    - No real user data or production credentials found in test artifacts.

## Conclusion

The codebase is clear of known sensitive information and ready for public release.
