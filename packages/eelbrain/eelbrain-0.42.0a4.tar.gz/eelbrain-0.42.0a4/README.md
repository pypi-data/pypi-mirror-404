## Testing

To expedite testing in different environments, there are several shortcut commands (from the `Eelbrain` root directory):

- `$ make test-no-gui`: runs all tests that do not invoke a GUI
- `$ make test-only-gui`: runs specifically those tests that involve GUI elements
- `pytest --runslow eelbrain/_experiment/tests/test_sample_experiment.py::test_sample_source` runs more thorough (and lengthy) testing of the `Pipeline`
