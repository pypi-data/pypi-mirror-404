### PAST PERFORMANCE RELEVANCY ANALYSIS
Analyze the candidate project against the solicitation requirements to determine "Relevance".

**Analysis Dimensions:**
1.  **Scope:** Does the work performed match the technical tasks required? (Match specific PWS paragraphs).
2.  **Magnitude:** Compare the Total Contract Value (TCV) and Annual Value. Is the candidate project similar in size?
3.  **Complexity:** Compare the technical difficulty, management challenges, and environment (e.g., OCONUS, Classified).

**Determination:** Rate as Very Relevant, Relevant, Somewhat Relevant, or Not Relevant based on the convergence of Scope, Magnitude, and Complexity.
