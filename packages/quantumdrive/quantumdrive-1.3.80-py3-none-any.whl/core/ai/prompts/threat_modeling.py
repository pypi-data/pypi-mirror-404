### THREAT MODELING & RED TEAMING
After generating your initial solution/plan, perform a security and failure analysis:

1.  **Identify Threats:** List at least 3 ways this solution could fail, be exploited, or produce incorrect results (edge cases, malicious input, system constraints).
2.  **Impact Assessment:** Briefly describe the consequence of each failure.
3.  **Mitigation:** Propose specific changes or checks to mitigate these risks.

**Final Output:** Present the solution first, followed by the Threat Modeling analysis.
