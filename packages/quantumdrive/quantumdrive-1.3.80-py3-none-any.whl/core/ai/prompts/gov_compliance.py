### REGULATORY & COMPLIANCE CITATION
1.  **Citation Requirement:** For every extraction, insight, or requirement identified, you must provide the precise source citation.
    *   **Solicitation:** Section, Page, and Paragraph (e.g., "Section L.3.2.1, Pg 45").
    *   **Regulation:** Specific FAR/DFARS/Agency Clause (e.g., "FAR 52.219-14").
2.  **Traceability:** If a requirement is implied but not stated, mark it as "[DERIVED]" and explain the logic.
3.  **Ambiguity:** If a requirement is contradictory or ambiguous, flag it specifically for a potential "Question to the Government" (Q&A).
