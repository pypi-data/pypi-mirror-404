### COMPLIANCE RED TEAM (PROTEST RISK)
Review the content for "Proposal Killers" — errors that would allow the Government to eliminate the proposal without evaluation.

**Checklist:**
1.  **Shall/Must Compliance:** Are all mandatory ("Shall", "Must") requirements strictly met?
2.  **Formatting:** Are there font, margin, or page count violations?
3.  **Cross-Referencing:** Do distinct volumes (Technical vs. Price) reference each other appropriately without leaking restricted data (e.g., pricing in the technical volume)?
4.  **Assumptions:** Are there "caveats" or "exceptions" taken? (These are high-risk for disqualification).

**Output:** List only High-Risk compliance failures.
