Shared Serial Manager - Centralized serial port management for multiple clients.

This module provides the SharedSerialManager class which allows multiple clients
to read serial output from a device (broadcast), while only one client can write
to it at a time (exclusive access). Key features:

- Centralized serial port management on the daemon
- Multiple "reader" clients can attach and receive serial output (broadcast)
- Single "writer" client has exclusive input access
- Output is buffered and distributed to all attached readers
- Thread-safe operations
- Handle reader/writer attach/detach

Example:
    >>> manager = SharedSerialManager()
    >>> # Open port and attach as reader
    >>> manager.open_port("COM3", 115200, client_id="client_1")
    >>> manager.attach_reader("COM3", "client_1")
    >>> # Another client can also read
    >>> manager.attach_reader("COM3", "client_2")
    >>> # Only one writer at a time
    >>> manager.acquire_writer("COM3", "client_1", timeout=5.0)
    >>> manager.write("COM3", "client_1", b"hello\\n")
    >>> manager.release_writer("COM3", "client_1")
    >>> # Get buffered output
    >>> lines = manager.read_buffer("COM3", "client_1")

    This class provides centralized serial port management where:
