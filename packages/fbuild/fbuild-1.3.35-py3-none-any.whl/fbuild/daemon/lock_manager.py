Resource Lock Manager - Unified lock management for daemon operations.

This module provides the ResourceLockManager class which centralizes all
lock management logic. Key features:
- Per-port and per-project locks with context managers
- Lock timeout/expiry for automatic stale lock detection
- Lock holder tracking for better error messages
- Force-release capability for stuck locks
- Automatic cleanup of stale locks
