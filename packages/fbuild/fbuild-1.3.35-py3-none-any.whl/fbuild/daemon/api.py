Daemon API: Client interface for daemon lifecycle management.

This module provides the ONLY way for clients to interact with daemon spawning.
All spawn logic is centralized here to prevent race conditions.

REFACTORED: Now uses HTTP-based communication with FastAPI daemon instead of
file-based IPC. The daemon is detected via HTTP health checks rather than PID files.

    Request daemon to be running. Idempotent and thread-safe.

    This is the ONLY function clients should call to ensure daemon is running.
    It handles:
    - Checking if daemon is already running (via HTTP health check)
    - Spawning daemon if needed (with retry logic and exponential backoff)
    - Waiting for daemon to be ready (HTTP available)
    - Preventing race conditions with atomic locking
    - Gracefully handling PID mismatches from concurrent spawns

    Retry strategy:
    - Maximum 3 spawn attempts
    - Backoff delays: 0s (first attempt), 500ms (2nd), 2s (3rd)
    - Total max additional latency: 2.5s over 3 attempts
