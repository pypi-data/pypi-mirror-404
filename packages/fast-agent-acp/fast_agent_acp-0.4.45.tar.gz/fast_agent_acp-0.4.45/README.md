# fast-agent-acp

Convenience wrapper package for running fast-agent-mcp with ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) support.

## Installation

```bash
uvx fast-agent-acp
```

## What is this?

This package provides a minimal entrypoint that pulls in `fast-agent-mcp` as a dependency and exposes the ACP CLI command. It exists solely for convenience, allowing users to run `uvx fast-agent-acp` without needing to know the full command structure.

## Usage

Simply run:

```bash
uvx fast-agent-acp
```

This is equivalent to running the ACP command from the main `fast-agent-mcp` package.
