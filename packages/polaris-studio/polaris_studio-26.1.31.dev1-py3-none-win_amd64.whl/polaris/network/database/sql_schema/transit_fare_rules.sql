--@ Transit fares can be associated to routes, in cases where routes have flat
--@ fares regardless of boarding and alighting stops. The other possible
--@ association is through the existing of fare zones, where trips are charged
--@ based on the combination of the transit zones for boarding and alighting.
--@
--@ This table includes both associations, thus records would have either the
--@ route_id or origin/destination fields as null.
