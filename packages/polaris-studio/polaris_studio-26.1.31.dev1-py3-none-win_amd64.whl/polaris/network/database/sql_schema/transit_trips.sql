--@ The Transit_Trips table holds the complete list of all transit services
--@ operating, for which one can override the information on capacity
--@ coming from route/pattern. There is also information on whether the
--@ vehicle is articulated or if it has multiple cars (applicable to rail), but
--@ both of these fields default to 0 in case of regular bus services.
--@
--@ The transit trip ID can be traced back to the pattern, route and agency
--@ directly through the encoding of their trip_id, as explained in the
--@ documentation for the Transit_Agencies table.
