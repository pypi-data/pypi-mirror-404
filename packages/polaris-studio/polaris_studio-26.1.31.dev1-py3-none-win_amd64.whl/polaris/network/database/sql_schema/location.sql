--@ The Location table holds all the activity and household locations in the
--@ model, on which all trips will ultimately start and end.
--@
--@ Given its central importance in the model, this table is connected to
--@ multiple other tables, both through data links and geographic ones.
--@
--@ Required by all models.

create TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Location(

    setback          REAL    NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,      --@ Auto-generated value of how far from node_a of the link this location is present along the length of the link
    "zone"           INTEGER,                         --@ Foreign key reference to the zone where this location in situated. Auto-generated through geo-consistency checks.

    notes            TEXT             DEFAULT "",     --@ Text area to specify notes about the location. Optional.
    popsyn_region    BIGINT  NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,      --@ Foreign key reference to the PopSyn_Region table denoting the collection of locations considered during population synthesis.
    county           BIGINT                    ,      --@ County code for the location. Used by the freight model and to compute aggregate statistics
    land_use         TEXT    NOT NULL DEFAULT "ALL",  --@ Text describing the land use type represented by this location. !LAND_USE!
    walk_link        BIGINT,                          --@ Foreign key reference to the nearest walk link from the Transit_Walk table
    walk_offset      REAL,                            --@ Same as offset above, but for the walk link.

    avg_parking_cost REAL             DEFAULT 0,      --@ Average parking cost when visiting the location. Used in the activity planning stage.
    res_charging     REAL,                            --@ Denotes the proportion of households at this location that have residential charging available.
    stop_flag        INTEGER          DEFAULT 0,      --@ Boolean to denote whether or not a location is a TNC stop, primarily for aggregated pickups and drop-offs. May be deprecated.
    tod_distance     REAL    NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,      --@ Walk distance to the closest high-quality transit stop, in meters. The definition of "high quality" is user dependent and can be calculated using the DistanceToTransit class from Polaris-Studio.
