--@ This table is the junction of two different types of links:
--@    * Network links (from the links table) that can be traversed by walk
--@    * Access links connecting stops and micro-mobility docks to the network
--@
--@ This network is static and should be re-created any time there are changes
--@ in the transit data (e.g. import of a new GTFS feed), or whenever new
--@ micromobility docks are added to the supply database.
--@
--@ It important to understand that the number of links in this network is
--@ substantially larger than in the **links** table because it has links
--@ connecting each stop/dock to the physical network, as well as links
--@ connecting transit stops (and docks) stops directly to each other whenever
--@ they are very close (the distance between them is half of that between them
--@ and the physical network.
--@
--@ Physical links are also broken to allow stops to be connected by walk in the
--@ middle of links, where stops are actually located. We attempt to reduce the
--@ number of link breaks by combining access links into the same point whenever
--@ possible and without penalizing agents with substantially longer walk
--@ distances.
