--@ The TNC_Request table stores records for all requests recevied by any shared mobility operator in POLARIS.
--@ A variety of information is recorded to understand demand for the different shared mobility services, and
--@ the outcome details when trying to serve the request is also logged. 
--@
--@ The data in this table is purely an output of POLARIS and is not read back in by subsequent iterations.
