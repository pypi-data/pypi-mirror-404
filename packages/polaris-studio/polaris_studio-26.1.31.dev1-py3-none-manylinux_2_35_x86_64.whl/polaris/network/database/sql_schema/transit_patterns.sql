--@ The Transit_Patterns table exists because most routes have the same sequence
--@ of stops for many of its trips during the day, so it would be redundant to
--@ store the same list of stop sequence for trips with identical ones.
--@
--@ As an intermediary table between routes and trips, it is linked to both of
--@ those tables and can also have distinct capacities that override those from
--@ the routes tables whenever inserted in this table.
--@
--@ The transit pattern ID can be traced back to the route and agency directly
--@ through the encoding of their pattern_id, as explained in the documentation
--@ for the Transit_Agencies table.

--@ Due to the difficulty of map-matching GTFS feeds, it is conceivable that the
--@ route shape found during the matching problem will not be perfectly correct,
--@ so verifying the geometry of patterns is recommended.
