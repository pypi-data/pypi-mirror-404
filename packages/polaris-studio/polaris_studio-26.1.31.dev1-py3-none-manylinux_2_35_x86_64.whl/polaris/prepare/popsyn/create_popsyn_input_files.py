# List of years synpop input file generation has successfully run before.
# Note there are three main areas where this process might break:
#  1. seed data column names and values
#  2. control total field names and values
#  3. geo crosswalk (associating pumas with census tracts)
# Regarding 1., we test for mandatory column names however we currently do not validate numeric values so a change in
#  definition of a variable could lead to a mismatch with control data, as defined in the {}MARGVAR part of the linker
#  file.
# Regarding 2., we define a control field that represents the sum of all sub-fields, which should catch a name change
#  when variables are added/removed from 5-year ACS data.
# Regarding 3., PUMAs can change during census years, the latest of which was 2020. Tose definitions will make their
#  way into this data at some point and could result in mismatches between tract ids and data.
#  get_tract_to_puma_crosswalk takes a url to the puma-tract mapping, which currently defaults to 2010.
