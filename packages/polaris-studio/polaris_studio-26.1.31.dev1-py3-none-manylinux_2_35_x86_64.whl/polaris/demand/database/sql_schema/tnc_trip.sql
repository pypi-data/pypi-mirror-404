--@ The TNC_Trip table stores all trips made by shared mobility vehicles - referred to here as TNC vehicles.
--@ Each record in the table includes a leg of travel - either pickup, dropoff, charging, or repositioning.
--@ Several records together for a specific vehicle may form a tour, meaning the vehicle was continuously in operation
--@ from one trip to the next, without a break.
