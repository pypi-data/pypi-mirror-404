# Simple Python package

[![Publish to PyPI](https://github.com/gperdrizet/simple-python-package/actions/workflows/publish-to-pypi.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gperdrizet/simple-python-package/actions/workflows/publish-to-pypi.yml)

This repository is a minimal template for publishing a small Python package to PyPI using GitHub Actions and trusted publishing.

## Quick start

1. Fork this repository on GitHub and mark your fork as a template via the repo settings (once)
2. Try and/or remove the demo files from your fork: `src/lorenz.py` & `notebooks/lorenz_demo.py` (once)
3. Create a pending publisher on [PyPI.org](https://pypi.org) (each new project)
4. Create a new repository for your project from your template fork on GitHub (each new project)
5. Update `pyproject.toml` to reflect your new project's metadata (each new project)
6. Commit and push your code (each code update)
7. Tag and publish a release on GitHub - this will trigger the workflow to publish the current commit to PyPI (each code update)

```
## Usage

### 1. Fork and mark the template (once)

1. Fork this repository.
2. In the fork, open **Settings → General → Template repository** and enable it.

### 2. Try or remove the demo (once)

This repository ships a tiny demo package (`lorenz`) used to illustrate packaging and publishing. You can try it locally or remove it before starting your own project.

#### 2.1. Try the demo locally


1. Open the repo in a devcontainer or GitHub Codespace.
2. Install the package in editable mode:
following
	```text
	pip install -e .
	```

3. Run the demo notebook [notebooks/lorenz_demo.ipynb](notebooks/lorenz_demo.ipynb)

#### 2.2. Install the demo from PyPI

Since the demo package has been published to PyPI from this repo, you can install it via pip anywhere:

```text
pip install simple-python-package
```

#### 2.3. Remove the demo from your fork

If you want a clean template fork to start new projects, simply delete the demo files:
- `src/lorenz.py](src/lorenz.py`
- `notebooks/lorenz_demo.ipynb`


### 3. Create a pending publisher on PyPI (each new project)

1. In PyPI, go to **Project → Publishing → Trusted Publishers**.
2. Add a pending publisher with these values:
	- **PyPI Project Name**: must be unique, site-wide
	- **Owner**: your GitHub user or org
	- **Repository**: your repo name
	- **Workflow**: `publish-to-pypi.yml`
	- **Environment**: `pypi`

Do this first, before naming the GitHub repository to determine if your planned name is available on PyPI. PyPI project names must be unique site-wide. The GitHub repo and PyPI project names don't have to match, but it's nice if they do.

### 4. Create a new repository from your template (each new project)

1. In your template fork, click **Use this template** on GitHub.
2. Create a new repository for your project.

### 5. Update project metadata (each new project)

Update `pyproject.toml` with your project metadata:

- Change `name`, `authors` and `description`
- Update `classifiers`, `keywords`, and `dependencies`
- Replace or remove `[project.urls]`

### 6. Commit and push (each code update)

Use the repo to develop your project as you normally would. Place Python modules to be published as part of your package in the `src/` directory. Commit and push your code to GitHub.

### 7. Tag and publish a release (each code update)

1. Create a GitHub release tag that matches your current `version` in `pyproject.toml` (e.g., `0.1.0` or `v0.1.0` - see [here](https://semver.org/) for information about version numbering).
2. The **Publish to PyPI** workflow will build and publish automatically.

If you prefer a manual run, you can trigger the workflow from the **Actions** tab.
