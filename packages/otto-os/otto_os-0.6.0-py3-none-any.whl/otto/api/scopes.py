"""
Permission Scopes for OTTO Public REST API
==========================================

Defines granular permission scopes for API key access control.

Scopes follow a hierarchical pattern:
- read:* - Read-only access
- write:* - Modification access
- admin - Full access

Sensitive fields (requiring read:state:full):
- burnout_level, energy_level, momentum_phase
- epistemic_tension, convergence_attractor
- rapid_exchange_count

ThinkingMachines [He2025] Compliance:
- FIXED scope names and values
- DETERMINISTIC: scope → permission mapping
