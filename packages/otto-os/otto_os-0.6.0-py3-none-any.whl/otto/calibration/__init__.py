"""
Calibration Module
==================

Cross-session learning and user preference adaptation.

This module implements LIVRPS Layer 12 (Calibration) - learned overrides
that persist across sessions and adapt to user behavior patterns.

Architecture:
    Session (L13) → Calibration (L12) → Base Profile (L11) → Defaults (L10)

Components:
- CalibrationStore: Persistence layer for learned values (calibration.usda)
- OutcomeTracker: Records expert acceptance/rejection patterns
- CalibrationLearner: Hebbian learning with bounded weights
- ConfidenceScorer: RC^+xi convergence for learned values
- CalibrationManager: Orchestrates all calibration operations

ThinkingMachines [He2025] Compliance:
- Fixed learning rate and bounds
- Deterministic weight updates
- Reproducible calibration values
