"""
Human Phrases Dictionary
========================

Dignity-first language for OTTO's user-facing messages.

CRITICAL RULE: No clinical language.
- Never: ADHD, disorder, symptom, manage, cope, dysfunction, executive function
- Always: Human descriptions of states and feelings

These phrases transform internal cognitive states into supportive,
human language that doesn't label or diagnose.
