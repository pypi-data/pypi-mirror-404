"""
Helpers to read/load artifacts from the Nix store for ryxpress.

Behavior:

- Resolve derivation outputs (single path or list of paths) via rxp_inspect
  or by accepting a literal /nix/store/... path.
- When a single file is resolved:
  - Try to unpickle the file first (regardless of extension). If that succeeds,
    return the loaded object.
  - Otherwise try to load using rds2py (if available) and return that object.
  - If neither works, return the path (string) — do not raise or warn.
- If multiple outputs are resolved, return the list of paths.
- The functions intentionally avoid raising errors or emitting warnings for
  normal "can't load this artifact" cases; they prefer to return the path(s).
