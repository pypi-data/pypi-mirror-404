"""
Initialize an rixpress project by creating gen-env.R and gen-pipeline.R.

This is a direct translation of the R function `rxp_init` into Python.

Behavior:

- Creates (overwrites) two files in the project directory:
  - gen-env.R
  - gen-pipeline.R

- Asks the user for confirmation before making changes, unless skip_prompt=True.
- Creates the project directory if it does not exist.
- If running non-interactively (e.g. CI), skips Git initialization and returns True.
- If the user agrees to initialise git, attempts to run `git init` in the project directory.
  If `git` is not available it prints an informative message.
- Returns True on successful initialization, False if the user cancels before making changes.
