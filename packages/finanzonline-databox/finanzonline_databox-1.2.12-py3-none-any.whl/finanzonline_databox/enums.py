"""Domain enums for configuration and output formatting.

Provides type-safe enumeration values for output formats, deployment targets,
and other fixed string values used throughout the application.

Contents:
    * :class:`OutputFormat` - Output format options for config display
    * :class:`DeployTarget` - Configuration deployment target layers

System Role:
    Acts as the single source of truth for fixed string values, eliminating
    magic strings and enabling type-safe comparisons throughout the codebase.
