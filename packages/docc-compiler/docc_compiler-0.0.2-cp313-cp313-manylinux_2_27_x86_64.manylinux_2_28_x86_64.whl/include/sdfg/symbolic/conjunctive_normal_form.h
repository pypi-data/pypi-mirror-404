/**
 * @file conjunctive_normal_form.h
 * @brief Conversion of conditions to conjunctive normal form (CNF)
 *
 * This file provides functionality for converting boolean conditions into
 * conjunctive normal form.
 *
 * ## Conjunctive Normal Form
 *
 * CNF is a standardized format for boolean expressions where the expression is
 * represented as a conjunction (AND) of clauses, where each clause is a disjunction
 * (OR) of literals. For example:
 *   (A OR B) AND (C OR D OR E) AND (F)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * @code
 * auto x = symbolic::symbol("x");
 * auto y = symbolic::symbol("y");
 *
 * // Create a complex condition: (x > 0 AND y < 10) OR (x < 0 AND y > 10)
 * auto cond = symbolic::Or(
 *     symbolic::And(symbolic::Gt(x, zero()), symbolic::Lt(y, integer(10))),
 *     symbolic::And(symbolic::Lt(x, zero()), symbolic::Gt(y, integer(10)))
 * );
 *
 * // Convert to CNF
 * auto cnf = conjunctive_normal_form(cond);
 * // Result is a vector of clauses, each clause being a vector of conditions
 * @endcode
 *
 * @see symbolic.h for building boolean conditions
