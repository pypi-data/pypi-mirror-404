 * Each control flow node in a Sequence has an associated Transition that
 * is executed after the node completes. The transition's assignments update

/**
 * @brief A sequential container of control flow nodes
 *
 * A Sequence represents a sequential execution of control flow nodes. It is
 * the fundamental container in structured control flow, serving as:
 * - The root container of a StructuredSDFG
 * - The body of loops (For, While, Map)
 * - Each branch of an IfElse
 *
 * A Sequence contains:
 * - A list of child control flow nodes (Block, IfElse, loops, etc.)
 * - A transition for each child (containing symbol assignments)
 *
 * Children are executed sequentially in order. After each child completes,
 * its associated transition executes, potentially updating symbol values
 * before the next child begins.
 *
 * **Structure:**
 * ```
 * Sequence:
 *   Child[0] -> Transition[0] (assignments)
 *   Child[1] -> Transition[1] (assignments)
 *   ...
 *   Child[n-1] -> Transition[n-1] (assignments)
 * ```
