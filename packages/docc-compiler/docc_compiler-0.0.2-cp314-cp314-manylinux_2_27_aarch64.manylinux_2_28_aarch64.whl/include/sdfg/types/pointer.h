 * @class Pointer
 * @brief Represents a pointer type
 *
 * The Pointer class represents a pointer to another type. Pointers can be:
 * - Typed: pointing to a specific type (e.g., `int*`, `float*`)
 * - Opaque: pointing to an unknown or void type (e.g., `void*`)
 *
 * Pointers are fundamental for representing memory addresses, dynamic data structures,
 * and references to data in different memory spaces (CPU heap, GPU memory, etc.).
 *
 * @note The pointee type is optional to support void pointers and opaque pointers.
