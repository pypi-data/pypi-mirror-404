/**
 * @class MemletLinearization
 * @brief Linearizes memlet base types by flattening nested arrays
 *
 * This pass transforms memlets that have pointer base types pointing to nested
 * arrays. It converts such pointers into flat pointers to the innermost element
 * type, and adjusts the subset accordingly by linearizing multi-dimensional
 * array accesses into a single linear index.
 *
 * For example, a pointer to int[3][4] with subset [i, j] becomes a pointer to
 * int with subset [i * 4 + j].
 *
 * This linearization simplifies subsequent passes and code generation by
 * eliminating nested array types in pointer pointees.
