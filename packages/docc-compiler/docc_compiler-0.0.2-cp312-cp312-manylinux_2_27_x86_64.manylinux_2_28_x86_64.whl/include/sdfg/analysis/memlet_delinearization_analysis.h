/**
 * @class MemletDelinearizationAnalysis
 * @brief Analysis that delinearizes memlet subsets
 *
 * This analysis traverses all blocks in the SDFG and attempts to delinearize
 * the subset of each memlet. For memlets where delinearization is successful,
 * it stores the delinearized subset using sparse storage (only successful
 * delinearizations are stored in the map).
 *
 * The analysis uses the symbolic::delinearize function with assumptions from
 * the AssumptionsAnalysis for each block.
 *
 * The delinearization technique is based on the algorithm described in:
 * "Polyhedral AST generation is more than scanning polyhedra"
 * by Grosser et al., ACM TACO 2015.
