"""GraphQL-backed dot-path browser for Poelis SDK.

This module is the **public** import location for the Browser DSL:

    - ``from poelis_sdk.browser import Browser``

Internally, the implementation is split across multiple files under
``poelis_sdk._browser``. This file intentionally re-exports the public surface
to keep backwards compatibility while allowing a maintainable structure.

Important:
    The refactor is **structural only**: runtime behavior should remain the
    same. If you find a behavioral difference, treat it as a bug.
