# seisclass

Seismic event classification package for identifying natural and non-natural earthquakes.

## Overview

`seisclass` is a Python package designed to classify seismic events using deep learning models. It provides one main function:
- `check_seed`: Analyzes a seismic data file (SEED format) with corresponding phase file, returning a comma-separated result string: event_type,earthquake_prob,explode_prob,collapse_prob

For detailed information about the program and to cite it in your research publications, please refer to the following papers:

Git-Repository: [https://github.com/epnet2018/]

## Usage
### Basic Usage
```python
from seisclass import check_seed
# Analyze a SEED file with corresponding phase file
result = check_seed('path/to/seed/file', 'path/to/phase/file')
print(result)
```
### phase file format
The phase file should be in the following format:
```
station,channel,time,phase
```
where `station` is the station code, `channel` is the channel code, `time` is the arrival time of the phase, and `phase` is the phase type (e.g., P, S).
