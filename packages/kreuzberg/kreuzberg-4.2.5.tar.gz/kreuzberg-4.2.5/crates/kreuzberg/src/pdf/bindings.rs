/// Subsequent calls to `Pdfium::bind_to_library()` or `Pdfium::bind_to_system_library()`
/// will fail with a library loading error because the dynamic library is already loaded.
///
/// Additionally, `Pdfium::new()` calls `FPDF_InitLibrary()` which must only be called once,
/// and when `Pdfium` is dropped, it calls `FPDF_DestroyLibrary()` which would invalidate
/// all subsequent PDF operations.
///
/// This singleton ensures:
/// 1. Library binding happens exactly once (on first access)
/// 2. `FPDF_InitLibrary()` is called exactly once
/// 3. The `Pdfium` instance is never dropped, so `FPDF_DestroyLibrary()` is never called
/// 4. All callers share the same `Pdfium` instance safely
///
/// CRITICAL: We use `&'static Pdfium` (a leaked reference) instead of `Pdfium` to prevent
/// the instance from being dropped during process exit. Without this, when Rust's runtime
/// cleans up static variables during process teardown, the Pdfium destructor runs and calls
/// `FPDF_DestroyLibrary()`, which can cause segfaults/SIGTRAP (exit code 201 on macOS) in

///
/// In batch mode, PDFs will be processed sequentially rather than in parallel. However,
/// other document types (text, HTML, etc.) can still be processed in parallel. For
/// workloads with mixed document types, this provides good overall performance.
///
/// # Alternatives Considered
///
/// 1. **Process-based parallelism**: Spawn separate processes for PDF extraction.
///    This would allow true parallelism but adds significant complexity and overhead.
///
/// 2. **Thread-local PDFium instances**: Not possible because the library only allows
///    binding once per process (`FPDF_InitLibrary` can only be called once).
///
/// 3. **Disable batch mode for PDFs**: Would require changes to the batch orchestration
///    to detect PDF types and process them differently.

/// # Arguments
///
/// * `map_err` - Function to convert error strings into `PdfError` variants
/// * `context` - Context string for error messages (e.g., "text extraction")
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A `PdfiumHandle` that provides access to the global `Pdfium` instance via `Deref`.
/// The handle can be used anywhere a `&Pdfium` reference is expected.
///
/// # Performance
///
/// - **First call**: Performs full initialization (~8-12ms for bundled extraction + binding)
/// - **Subsequent calls**: Returns immediately (just fetches from `OnceLock`, ~nanoseconds)
///
/// This lazy initialization defers Pdfium setup until the first PDF is processed,
/// improving cold start time for non-PDF workloads.
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// This function is thread-safe but SERIALIZES access to PDFium:
/// - The `OnceLock` ensures initialization happens exactly once
/// - The `PDFIUM_OPERATION_LOCK` mutex ensures only one thread can access PDFium at a time
/// - The returned `PdfiumHandle` holds the mutex guard; when dropped, the lock is released
///
/// This serialization is necessary because PDFium is NOT thread-safe. Concurrent access
/// to PDFium from multiple threads causes crashes (segfaults, abort traps).
///
/// # Error Handling
///
/// If initialization fails (e.g., library not found, extraction failed), the error
/// is cached and returned on all subsequent calls. The process cannot recover from
/// a failed initialization - restart the process to retry.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// // First call initializes the singleton
/// let pdfium = bind_pdfium(PdfError::TextExtractionFailed, "text extraction")?;
///
/// // Use it like a &Pdfium
/// let document = pdfium.load_pdf_from_byte_slice(bytes, None)?;

/// let pdfium2 = bind_pdfium(PdfError::RenderingFailed, "page rendering")?;
