v5.3.2 (2026-01-30)
===================

Features
--------

- Integrate the dataset extras framework (`#267 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/267>`__)


v5.3.1 (2026-01-26)
===================

Misc
----

- Update name of `non_dark_or_polcal_readout_exp_times` constant to more accurately reflect what it is. This changed when
  we stopped using DARK and GAIN task type frames to correct POLCAL data. (`#265 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/265>`__)
- Use new base `Stems` in `dkist-processing-common` to speed up custom ViSP `Stems`. `TotalRasterStepsBud`, `ReflectedLightAngleBud`,
  and `NonDarkNonPolcalTaskReadoutExpTimesBud` are now based on `SetStem`, and `DarkReadoutExpTimesPickyBud` is based on `ListStem`. (`#265 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/265>`__)
- Update `dkist-processing-common` to v12.1.0 to take advantage of big speedups in the Parse task. (`#265 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/265>`__)

  failing fits caused by very poor initial guesses caused by large continuum offsets. (`#255 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/255>`__)


Misc
----

- Move the `estimate_relative_continuum_level` method from `SolarCalibration` class to be a module-level function in
  "wavelength_calibration.py" so it can be used by both the `SolarCalibration` and `WavelengthCalibration` tasks. (`#255 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/255>`__)
- Import the `WavelengthCalibration` task into the top-level `tasks` package and use that import path in workflow definitions. (`#255 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/255>`__)

  data that had their WCS axes switched in the headers. (`#234 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/234>`__)


Misc
----

- Update logging lines to print `np.int*` types as plain ints instead of the `__repr__`, which shows the full type. (`#253 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/253>`__)


Documentation
-------------

- Add online documentation page for new WavelengthCalibration task. (`#234 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/234>`__)


v5.1.2 (2025-12-08)
===================

  now run in parallel. (`#248 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/248>`__)


v5.0.0 (2025-12-02)
===================

Features
--------

- Only compute a single lamp gain for each beam. In the past a single map gain was also computed for each modulation state. (`#246 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/246>`__)
- Add quality report metrics that show the quality of the vignette estimation in the Solar Gain tasks. (`#246 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/246>`__)
- Update the Solar Gain task to measure vignetting signal, compute a single gain for each beam (as opposed to for each beam and modulator state),
  and stop applying residual spectral shifts to the characteristic spectra before removing from the input gain array.
  See the `Science Changelog <https://docs.dkist.nso.edu/projects/visp/en/stable/scientific_changelog.html>`_ and
  `gain algorithm docs <https://docs.dkist.nso.edu/projects/visp/en/stable/gain_correction.html>`_ for more information. (`#246 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/246>`__)

Misc
----

- Remove the `LineZonesMixin` and move its methods directly to the Geometric calibration task, which is now the only task that uses them. (`#246 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/246>`__)
- Rename the ``solar_spectral_avg_window`` to ``solar_spatial_median_filter_width_px`` to more accurately capture what it does. (`#246 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/246>`__)
- Rename all line-zone parameters to be "geo*" parameters instead of "solar*" parameters. These parameters are now only used in the
  Geometric calibration task. (`#246 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/246>`__)


Documentation
-------------

- Update the online doc page for `gain calibration <https://docs.dkist.nso.edu/projects/visp/en/stable/gain_correction.html>`_

  for linking bliss. (`#246 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/246>`__)


v4.0.0 (2025-11-12)
===================

Bugfixes

- Change how interpolations are done by copying edge pixels as opposed to reflecting them when filling gaps left behind by shifts. This will eliminate "ghost" lines. (`#235 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/235>`__)
- Update how edges are cropped in areas where both beams did not contribute to the L1 data array. The wrong edges were being cropped before. (`#242 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/242>`__)


Misc
----

- Replace L1 frame pixels with NaNs where the source data comes from a single beam. (`#235 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/235>`__)

===================

Misc
----

- Replace `FakeGQLClient` with the `fake_gql_client` fixture imported from the `mock_metadata_store` module
  in `dkist-processing-common`.  Because the fixture is imported into `conftest.py`, individual imports are not needed. (`#227 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/227>`__)


v3.3.0 (2025-07-10)
===================

====================

Features
--------

- Information about the initial set of values (e.g., the name of the GOS retarder) to use when fitting demodulation

===================

Misc
----

- Bumping common to 2.7.0: ParseL0InputData --> ParseL0InputDataBase, constant_flowers --> constant_buds (`#115 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/115>`__)


v2.2.0 (2023-05-16)
===================

Bugfixes
--------

- Lots of small updates to harden the beam angle calculation against pathological data. We are now resistant to lamp data with large gradients and/or data with a high density of bad pixels. (`#114 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/114>`__)


v2.1.1 (2023-05-05)
===================

Misc
----

- Update dkist-processing-common to 2.6.0 which includes an upgrade to airflow 2.6.0


v2.1.0 (2023-05-02)
===================

Features
--------

- Support for a parameter that sets the number of spatial bins used when computing demodulation matrices. This is mostly to speed up testing and deployment; real science data will probably not be binned at all. (`#112 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/112>`__)


Misc
----

- Offload calculation of "WAVEMIN/MAX" in L1 headers to new functionality in `*-common` that uses the already-defined `get_wavelength_range`. The result is that this logic now only lives in one place. (`#113 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/113>`__)


v2.0.2 (2023-04-24)
===================

v2.0.0 (2023-04-13)
===================

Features
--------

- Large improvements to gain algorithm. Primary improvement is usage of lamp gain images to help separate optical/spectral signals
  and improve solar characteristic spectra removal from solar gain images. (`#105 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/105>`__)
- Improve spatial residuals in polarimetric data by computing a demodulation matrix for every spatial pixel and then
  smoothing the resulting demodulation matrices in the spatial dimension. (`#106 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/106>`__)
- Normalize Q, U, and V polarimetric beams by their respective Stokes-I prior to beam combination, then multiply the combination
  by the average Stokes-I data. (`#107 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/107>`__)
- Improvement to accuracy of beam angle calculation. The angle is now measured directly from the hairlines instead of using a Hough transform,
  which has less accuracy due to the width of the hairlines. (`#108 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/108>`__)
- Use new and improved PAC fit mode for improved polarimetric accuracy. Also update code to support/interact with
  `dkist-processing-pac` >= 2.0.0. This is mostly renaming kwargs on API calls. Also removed unneeded dummy dimensions
  and renamed a matrix multiple function. (`#109 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/109>`__)


Misc
----

- Replace `logging.[thing]` with `logging42.logger.[thing]` for logging bliss. (`#104 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/104>`__)
