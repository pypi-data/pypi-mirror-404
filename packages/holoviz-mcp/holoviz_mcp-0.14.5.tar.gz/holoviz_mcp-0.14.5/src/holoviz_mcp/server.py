"""HoloViz MCP Server.

This MCP server provides comprehensive tools, resources and prompts for working with the HoloViz ecosystem,
including Panel and hvPlot following best practices.

The server is composed of multiple sub-servers that provide various functionalities:

- Documentation: Search and access HoloViz documentation as context
- hvPlot: Tools, resources and prompts for using hvPlot to develop quick, interactive plots in Python
- Panel: Tools, resources and prompts for using Panel Material UI

    This MCP server provides comprehensive tools, resources and prompts for exploring data, creating data visualizations,
    data tools, dashboards and data apps using the HoloViz ecosystem.

    Use this MCP server to get help, resources, and prompts for working with the HoloViz ecosystem effectively.

    HoloViz provides a set of core Python packages that make visualization easier, more accurate, and more powerful:

    - [Colorcet](https://colorcet.holoviz.org): for perceptually uniform colormaps.
    - [Datashader](https://datashader.org): for rendering even the largest datasets.
    - [GeoViews](https://geoviews.org): to extend HoloViews for geographic data.
    - [HoloViews](https://holoviews.org): to create advanced, interactive and high quality data visualizations.
    - [hvPlot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org): to quickly generate interactive plots from your data.
    - [Lumen](https://lumen.holoviz.org): to build data-driven dashboards from a simple YAML specification that's well suited to modern AI tools like LLMs.
    - [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org): for making data tools, dashboards and data apps using the Holoviz and wider PyData ecosystems.
    - [Param](https://param.holoviz.org): to create declarative user-configurable objects.
