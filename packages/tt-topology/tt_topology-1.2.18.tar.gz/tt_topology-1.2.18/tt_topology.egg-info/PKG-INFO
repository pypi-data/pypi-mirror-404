# TT-Topology

Tenstorrent Topology (TT-Topology) is a command line utility
used to flash multiple n150 or n300 cards on a system to use specific single-host ETH routing configurations.

It currently supports three configurations: mesh, linear, and torus.

> [!WARNING]
> `tt-topology` is not designed to be used with the following products:
> - BH PCIe cards
> - WH 6U Galaxy systems
> - BH 6U Galaxy systems
>
> The tool will throw an error if used with unsupported products.
>
> Additionally, `tt-topology` is designed to be used only in a single-host context. Multi-host topologies will not be discovered.

Tenstorrent Topology (TT-Topology) is a command line utility to flash ethernet coordinates when multiple NB's are connected together.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
  -l {linear,torus,mesh,isolated}, --layout {linear,torus,mesh,isolated}
                        Select the layout (linear, torus, mesh, isolated). Default is linear.
  -o, --octopus
  -f [filename], --filename [filename]
                        Change filename for test log. Default: ~/tt_smi/<timestamp>_snapshot.json
  -g, --generate_reset_json
                        Generate default reset json file that reset consumes. Update the generated file and use it as an input for the --reset option
  -ls, --list           List out all the boards on host with their coordinates and layout.
  --log [log]           Change filename for the topology flash log. Default: ~/tt_topology_logs/<timestamp>_log.json

                        Change the plot of the png that will have the graph layout of the chips. Default: chip_layout.png
  -r [config.json ...], --reset [config.json ...]
                        Provide a valid reset JSON

```
# TT-Topology Procedure

TT-Topology does the following when calculating and flashing the coordinates:
1. Flash all the boards to default - set all eth port disables to 0 and reset coordinates to (0,0) for local chips and (1,0) for n300 remote chips.
2. Issue a board level reset to apply the new flash to the chips.
3. Generate a mapping of all possible connections and their type between the available chips.
4. Using a graph algorithm generate coordinates for each chip based on user input. These layouts are discussed in detail in the sections below.
5. Write the new coordinates to the chips.
6. Issue a board level reset to apply the new flash to the chips.
7. Return a png with a graphic representation of the layout and a .json log file with details of the above steps.


# Chip layouts

TT-Topology can be used to flash one of the three chip layouts: mesh, linear and torus.

## Mesh

The mesh layout is a trivalent graph where each node can have a maximum of three connections. A BFS algorithm is used to assign the coordinates.

The command to generate a mesh layout is:

```
$ tt-topology -l mesh -p mesh_layout.png
```

For a host with two n300 cards and four n300 cards, the command will generate layouts that look like the following:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/mesh_layout_2x4.png?raw=true" alt="mesh_layout_2x4" width="47%"/>
  &nbsp; &nbsp;
  <img src="images/mesh_layout.png?raw=true" alt="mesh_layout_2x8" width="47%"/>
</p>

## Linear

The linear layout, as the name suggests, is a layout where all chips are connected in a single line. The coordinates are assigned by finding a cycle in the graph and then assigning coordinates in order.

The command to generate a linear layout is:

```
$ tt-topology -l linear -p linear_layout.png
```

For a host with two n300 cards and four n300 cards, the command will generate layouts that look like the following:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/linear_layout_2x4.png?raw=true" alt="linear_layout_2x4" width="47%"/>
  &nbsp; &nbsp;
  <img src="images/linear_layout.png?raw=true" alt="linear_layout_2x8" width="47%"/>
</p>


## Torus

The torus layout is a cyclic graph where a single line connects all nodes.

The coordinates are assigned by finding a cycle in the graph and then assigning coordinates in order.

The command to generate a torus layout is:

```
$ tt-topology -l torus -p torus_layout.png
```

For a host with two n300 cards and four n300 cards, the command will generate layouts that look like the following:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/torus_layout_2x4.png?raw=true" alt="torus_layout_2x4" width="47%"/>
  &nbsp; &nbsp;
  <img src="images/torus_layout.png?raw=true" alt="torus_layout_2x8" width="47%"/>
</p>

# Octopus (TGG/TG) Support in TT-Topology

- TGG setting: 8 n150 cards connected to 2 Galaxy 4U systems
- TG setting: 8 n150 cards connected to 1 Galaxy 4U system

## Usage
1. Generate a default mobo reset json file saved at ```~/.config/tenstorrent/reset_config.json``` by running the following command

    ```
    $ tt-topology -g
    ```

2. Fill in *"mobo"*, *"credo"*, and *"disabled_ports"* under *"wh_mobo_reset"*

    Here is an example of what your reset_config.json file may look like:
    ```
    {
        "time": "2024-03-06T20:12:27.640859",
        "host_name": "yyz-lab-212",
        "gs_tensix_reset": {
            "pci_index": []
        },
        "wh_link_reset": {
            "pci_index": [
                0,
                1,
                2,
                3
            ]
        },
        "re_init_devices": true,
        "wh_mobo_reset": [
            {
                "nb_host_pci_idx": [
                    0,
                    1,
                    2,
                    3
                  ],
                "mobo": "mobo-ce-44",
                "credo": [
                    "6:0",
                    "6:1",
                    "7:0",
                    "7:1"
                ],
                "disabled_ports": [
                    "0:2",
                    "1:2",
                    "6:2",
                    "7:2"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

3. Flashing multiple NB cards to use specific eth routing configurations by running the following command

    ```
    $ tt-topology -o -r ~/.config/tenstorrent/reset_config.json
    ```

## Internal Procedure
1. Setup `mobo_eth_en` on every local n150 to train with the Galaxy
2. Program the shelf/rack of the Galaxies
3. Program all local n150s to rack 0, shelf 0, x 0, y 0
4. Reset with the following `retimer_sel` and `disable_sel` and wait for training
    - `retimer_sel`: From the `credo` field of the reset json file for the specific Galaxy
    - `disable_sel`: All the other ports not specified by the `retimer_sel`
5. Check QSFP link and change shelf number for each n150 according to the shelf on the connected Galaxy
6. Program the x, y coords of the local n150s based on the other side of the link
7. Reset again with the `retimer_sel` and `disable_sel` and wait for training, and verify all chips show up
    - `retimer_sel`: From the `credo` field of the reset json file for the specific Galaxy
    - `disable_sel`: From the `disabled_ports` field of the reset json file for the specific Galaxy

# Logging

TT-Topology records the pre- and post-flash relevant SPI parameter values, connection maps, and coordinates of the chips in a .json file for record keeping and debugging.
By default it is stored at ```~/tt_topology_logs/<timestamp>_log.json```. This can be changed by using the `--log` CLI arg:

```
$ tt-topology --log new_log.json ...
```
