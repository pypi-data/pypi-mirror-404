description: "Import of potentially non-existent package"
ai_context: "AI sometimes invents plausible-sounding package names that don't exist"

pattern:
  type: import
  check: package_exists

message: "Package '{package_name}' may not exist - verify on PyPI"

fix:
  template: |
    # Verify the package exists on PyPI before using:
    # pip search {package_name}
    # Or check: https://pypi.org/project/{package_name}/

education: |
  AI assistants sometimes "hallucinate" package names that sound plausible but don't exist.
  Attackers can register these names with malicious code. Always verify packages exist
  on PyPI/npm before adding them to your project.
