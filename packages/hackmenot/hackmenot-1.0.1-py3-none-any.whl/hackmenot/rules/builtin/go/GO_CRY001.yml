description: "Detects use of weak MD5 hash algorithm"
ai_context: "AI often suggests MD5 for hashing which is cryptographically broken"

pattern:
  type: import
  names:
    - crypto/md5
    - md5

message: "Weak hash algorithm MD5: {code_snippet}"

fix:
  template: |
    # Use SHA-256 or stronger: crypto/sha256
    # import "crypto/sha256"
    # hash := sha256.Sum256(data)

education: |
  MD5 is cryptographically broken and should not be used for security purposes.
  Use SHA-256 or SHA-3 for secure hashing.
