  type: fstring
  contains: ["debug=True", "DEBUG=True", "DEBUG = True"]

message: "Debug mode appears to be enabled - ensure this is disabled in production"

  template: |
    # Use environment variable:
    # DEBUG = os.environ.get("DEBUG", "false").lower() == "true"

  AI-generated code often includes debug=True for convenience.
  Debug mode can expose sensitive information and should never be enabled in production.
  Use environment variables to control debug settings.
