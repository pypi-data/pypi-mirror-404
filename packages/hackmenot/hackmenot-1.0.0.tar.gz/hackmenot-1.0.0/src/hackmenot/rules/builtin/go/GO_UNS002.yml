description: Detects CGO import which bypasses Go memory safety
message: "CGO usage detected: {code_snippet}"

pattern:
  type: string
  contains: ['import "C"', "import \"C\""]

fix:
  template: "Consider pure Go alternatives when possible"

education: |
  CGO allows calling C code but bypasses Go's memory safety.
  Use pure Go implementations when available.
