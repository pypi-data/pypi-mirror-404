  Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) occurs when an attacker can control the URL
  that a server-side application fetches. This can be used to access internal services,
  cloud metadata endpoints (169.254.169.254), or perform port scanning.
  Always validate URLs against an allowlist of trusted hosts.
