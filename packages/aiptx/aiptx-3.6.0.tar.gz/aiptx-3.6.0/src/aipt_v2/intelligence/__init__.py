"""
AIPT Intelligence Module

Advanced analysis capabilities for penetration testing:
- CVE prioritization and RAG-based tool selection
- Vulnerability chaining (connect related findings into attack paths)
- AI-powered triage (prioritize findings by real-world impact)
- Scope enforcement (ensure testing stays within authorization)
- Authenticated scanning (test protected resources)
- LLM-powered tool selection and vulnerability analysis
- Feedback learning from exploitation attempts
- Adaptive payload generation
- Knowledge graph for findings
- Real-time adaptation to defenses
- Cross-target correlation
