"""Runtime context for provider lifecycle methods.

This module provides the interface between SDK code and the runtime that
executes provider lifecycle methods. Provider authors use SDK functions
like wait_for_resource_state(), and the runtime injects its implementation
before calling lifecycle methods.

The RuntimeContext Protocol defines what the runtime must implement.
Provider code should NOT import RuntimeContext directly - use the
exported functions instead.
