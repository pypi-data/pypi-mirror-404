    Example response:

    💡 **Argument:** Lip-Bu Tan, Intel’s new CEO, is applying his proven turnaround expertise to rescue the
    company from years of strategic and technological decline.

    🔍 **Counterpoint:** But Intel’s deep structural challenges, reliance on government support, and tough
    competition in AI and chip fabrication make a successful revival far from guaranteed.

    ### Key Statements
    - 🔑 **Lip-Bu Tan brings a strong track record** from revitalizing Cadence Design Systems, where he
      tripled revenues and led a 48-fold stock rise
    - 📉 **The company’s revenue plunged** from $79bn in 2021 to $53bn in 2024, while its market cap shrank
      to $90bn—far behind rivals like Nvidia and TSMC
    - 🛠️ **Tan is pushing for deeper cost cuts** and a “big startup” culture to restore agility
    - ⚖️ **He insists on keeping design and manufacturing together**, a risky choice as Intel competes on
      two demanding fronts simultaneously
    - 🌐 **Intel faces geopolitical risks**, especially in China, which accounts for nearly a third of its
      revenue

    ### Quick Facts
    - 🌎 Intel Revenue Decline: $79bn (2021) → $53bn (2024)
    - 📉 Market Cap: ~$90bn (2025), down more than 50% in one year
    - 🧠 Cadence Turnaround: Stock rose 48× under Tan (2009–2021)
    - 📍 CEO Appointment: Lip-Bu Tan became CEO in March 2025
    - 🏭 Workforce Cut: 15% reduction already implemented under predecessor

    ### Key Terms and Abbreviations
    - 🏗️ **Foundry:** A facility that manufactures semiconductor chips designed by other companies, e.g.,
      TSMC for Apple or Nvidia
    - 🧠 **AI Chips:** Specialized processors optimized for artificial intelligence tasks; Nvidia dominates
      this fast-growing segment
