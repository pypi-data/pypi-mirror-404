"""
This module contains callback lists


--------------------

This script shows the most simple example of adding a handler.

```../examples/bpy.app.handlers.py```


--------------------

By default handlers are freed when loading new files, in some cases you may
want the handler stay running across multiple files (when the handler is
part of an add-on for example).

For this the bpy.app.handlers.persistent decorator needs to be used.

```../examples/bpy.app.handlers.1.py```


--------------------

Altering data from handlers should be done carefully. While rendering the
frame_change_pre

 and frame_change_post

 handlers are called from one
thread and the viewport updates from a different thread. If the handler changes
data that is accessed by the viewport, this can cause a crash of Blender. In
such cases, lock the interface (Render → Lock Interface or
bpy.types.RenderSettings.use_lock_interface) before starting a render.

Below is an example of a mesh that is altered from a handler:

```../examples/bpy.app.handlers.2.py```
