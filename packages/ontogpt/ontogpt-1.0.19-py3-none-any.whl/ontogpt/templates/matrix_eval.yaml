title: MATRIX Data Source Evaluation Template
description: >-
  A template for extracting and evaluating information about data resources
  for the MATRIX knowledge graph project. This template enables systematic
  scoring of data sources across multiple dimensions including domain coverage,
  source scope, utility for drug-disease modeling, and data quality/noise levels.
  The evaluation framework supports evidence-based selection and prioritization
  of knowledge graph data sources for drug repurposing applications.

      0:
        description: >-
          Low Noise: Well-curated, ≥85% precision; mechanistic/functional edges;
          clean, actionable data with no irrelevant edges.
      -1:
        description: >-
          Moderate Noise: Substantial fraction of edges generic/ambiguous;
          precision 70-85%; confidence scoring present but data needs refinement.
      -2:
        description: >-
          High Noise: Majority of edges are text-mined/generic with <70% precision;
          many irrelevant or unscored edges; heavy filtering needed.
