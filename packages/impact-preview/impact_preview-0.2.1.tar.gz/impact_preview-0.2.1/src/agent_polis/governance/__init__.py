Governance module - proposals, voting, and sanctions.

This module is Phase 2 of the roadmap. It will include:
- Proposals with structured debate (pro/con threads)
- Multiple voting mechanisms (majority, quadratic, supermajority)
- Graduated sanctions system
- Conflict resolution
- Reputation based on prediction accuracy

For now, this is a placeholder to ensure the package structure is correct.
