# PSAIR - Python Scaffolding for Analysis Itineraries in Research

**Status:** Early-stage, active development (version 0.0.1a2).  
**Stability:** APIs and module structure are subject to significant change.  
**Intended Audience:** Developers and researchers working with CLATR- or ALASTR-like tools.

PSAIR is an experimental backend architecture intended to support structured data handling, exploratory data analysis, and scalable workflow orchestration across CLATR-style (linguistic) pipelines. At present, it functions as a staging environment for prototyping generalized utilities for later integration.

## Key Principles
- **Modularity:** Components are being designed to operate independently or as plug-ins to downstream analysis systems.
- **Generalization:** PSAIR will evolve into a domain-agnostic backend for linguistic datasets.
- **Refactor-Friendly:** Expect reorganizations, renamings, and experimental interfaces.

## Current State
PSAIR is **not** ready for field use (no CLI function yet).  
Documentation will expand once the core architecture stabilizes.  
Issues and pull requests are welcome, but major revisions are expected.
