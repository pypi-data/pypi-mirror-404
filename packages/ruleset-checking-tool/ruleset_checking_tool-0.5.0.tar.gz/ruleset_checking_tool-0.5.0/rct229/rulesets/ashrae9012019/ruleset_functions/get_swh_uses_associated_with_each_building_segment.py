    Description: This function gets all the SWH uses connected to a building segment. This function is primarily to encapsulate getting service water heating uses in one function so that if a change is made in the schema as to how service water heating use is specified, the RCT only needs to change in one place.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rmd: dict
        RMD at RuleSetModelDescription level

    Returns
    -------
    swh_uses_dict: dict
        A dictionary where the keys are all the building segment ids and the value is a list `service_water_heating_uses` object.
