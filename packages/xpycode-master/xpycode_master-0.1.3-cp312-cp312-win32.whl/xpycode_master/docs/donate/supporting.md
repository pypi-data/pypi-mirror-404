# Supporting XPyCode

Help us continue the XPyCode development → [Donate](https://xpycode.com/donate)

## Why make a donation?

The funding will be used to continue the development of XPyCode and bring it to a stable, secure, and production-ready release.

During the alpha and beta phases, the tool will remain freely available and license-free, which requires dedicated resources without immediate revenue.

Contributions will support:

- Core development and stabilization
- Security reviews and hardening
- Bug fixing, testing, and performance improvements
- Documentation and user support
- Promotion and community outreach to help establish XPyCode as a trusted standard for Python–Excel integration

This funding phase is essential to ensure long-term quality, reliability, and adoption before introducing any paid licensing model.

!!! tip "Support the Project"
    If you find value in XPyCode today, one simple way to support the project is to contribute as if the license already existed — for example, by donating around €3 per month.
