## The Pitch

You're at the beach. Phone buzzes — production's on fire.

**Old you:** Panic. Find WiFi. Open laptop. Wait for IDE. Lose your tan.

**Vibe Remote you:** Open Slack. Type "Fix the auth bug in login.py". Watch Claude Code fix it in real-time. Approve. Sip margarita.

```
AI works. You live.
```

## Why This Exists

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Claude Code is amazing but needs a terminal | Slack IS your terminal now |
| Context-switching kills flow | Stay in one app |
| Can't code from phone | Yes you can |
| Multiple agents, multiple setups | One Slack, any agent |

**Supported Agents:**
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) — Deep reasoning, complex refactors
- [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) — Fast, extensible, community favorite  
- [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) — OpenAI's coding model

### Instant Notifications

Get notified the moment your AI finishes. Like assigning tasks to employees — delegate, go do something else, and come back when the work is done. No need to babysit.

### Thread = Session

Each Slack thread is an isolated workspace. Open 5 threads, run 5 parallel tasks. Context stays separate.

### Interactive Prompts

When your agent needs input — file selection, confirmation, options — Slack pops up buttons or a modal. Full CLI interactivity, zero terminal required.

## How It Works

```
┌──────────────┐         ┌──────────────┐         ┌──────────────┐
│     You      │  Slack  │ Vibe Remote  │  stdio  │  AI Agent    │
│  (anywhere)  │ ──────▶ │  (your Mac)  │ ──────▶ │ (your code)  │
└──────────────┘         └──────────────┘         └──────────────┘
```

1. **You type** in Slack: *"Add dark mode to the settings page"*
2. **Vibe Remote** routes to your configured agent
3. **Agent** reads your codebase, writes code, streams back
4. **You review** in Slack, iterate in thread

**Your code never leaves your machine.** Vibe Remote runs locally and connects via Slack's Socket Mode.

---

## Commands

| In Slack | What it does |
|----------|--------------|
| `@Vibe Remote /start` | Open control panel |
| `/stop` | Kill current session |
| Just type | Talk to your agent |
| Reply in thread | Continue conversation |

**Pro tip:** Each Slack thread = isolated session. Start multiple threads for parallel tasks.

---

## Instant Agent Switching

Need a different agent mid-conversation? Just prefix your message:

```
Plan: Design a new caching layer for the API
```

That's it. No menus, no commands. Type `AgentName:` and your message routes to that agent instantly.

---

## Per-Channel Routing

Different projects, different agents:

```
#frontend    → OpenCode (fast iteration)
#backend     → Claude Code (complex logic)  
#prototypes  → Codex (quick experiments)
```

Configure in web UI → Channels.

---

## CLI

```bash
vibe          # Start everything
vibe status   # Check if running
vibe stop     # Stop everything
vibe doctor   # Diagnose issues
```

---

## Prerequisites

You need at least one coding agent installed:

<details>
<summary><b>OpenCode</b> (Recommended)</summary>

```bash
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```

**Required:** Add to `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` to skip permission prompts:

```json
{
  "permission": "allow"
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Code</b></summary>

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Codex</b></summary>

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex
```
</details>

## Security

- **Local-first** — Vibe Remote runs on your machine
- **Socket Mode** — No public URLs, no webhooks
- **Your tokens** — Stored in `~/.vibe_remote/`, never uploaded
- **Your code** — Stays on your disk, sent only to your chosen AI provider

---

## Uninstall

```bash
vibe stop && uv tool uninstall vibe-remote && rm -rf ~/.vibe_remote
```

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] SaaS Mode
- [ ] Vibe Remote Coding Agent (one agent to rule them all)
- [ ] File attachments in Slack
- [ ] Multi-workspace

## Remote Server Tip (SSH)

If you run Vibe Remote on a remote server, keep the Web UI bound to `127.0.0.1:5123` and access it via SSH port forwarding:

```bash
ssh -NL 5123:localhost:5123 user@server-ip
```

See: **[CLI Reference](docs/CLI.md)** (search for "Remote Web UI Access")
