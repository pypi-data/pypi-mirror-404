# arcadia-microscopy-tools

[![uv](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astral-sh/uv/main/assets/badge/v0.json)](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

This repository contains a Python package called `arcadia_microscopy_tools`. The purpose of this Python package is for facilitating analysis of large-scale microscopy datasets generated by Arcadia's imaging suite which includes several microscopes:
- Nikon ECLIPSE Ti2-E (Hina)
- Nikon ECLIPSE Ni-E (Babu Frik)
- Leica Stellaris 8 (The Borg)

This package provides tooling for image preprocessing, cell/particle segmentation, morphology analysis, fluorescence quantification, and batch processing pipelines. Supports native ND2 file format via [nd2](https://github.com/tlambert03/nd2). LIF file support is in progress and will use [liffile](https://github.com/nimne/liffile). The package integrates with popular scientific Python libraries for streamlined high-content screening and quantitative microscopy workflows.

## Installation

### Basic installation

Install the core package with essential dependencies:

```bash
pip install arcadia-microscopy-tools
```

### Optional dependencies

Install with optional features using extras:

- `[segmentation]` - Cellpose for cell/particle segmentation
- `[compute]` - Modal for cloud-based processing
- `[all]` - All optional dependencies

```bash
# Example: install with segmentation support
pip install "arcadia-microscopy-tools[segmentation]"

# Or install all optional dependencies
pip install "arcadia-microscopy-tools[all]"
```

## Usage

### Loading microscopy images

Load ND2 files from Nikon microscopes:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from arcadia_microscopy_tools.microscopy import MicroscopyImage

# Load a Nikon ND2 file
example_nd2_path = Path("src/arcadia_microscopy_tools/tests/data/example-multichannel.nd2")
image = MicroscopyImage.from_nd2_path(example_nd2_path)

# Access basic properties
image.shape          # Array shape: (4, 256, 256)
image.sizes          # Dimension mapping: {'C': 4, 'Y': 256, 'X': 256}
image.channels       # List of Channel objects: [Channel(name='BRIGHTFIELD', ...), ...]
image.num_channels   # Number of channels: 4
```

Load LIF files from Leica microscopes:

```python
# Load a Leica LIF file
image = MicroscopyImage.from_lif_path(Path("path/to/image.lif"))
```

### Working with channels

Extract intensity data for specific channels:

```python
from arcadia_microscopy_tools.channels import DAPI

# Get intensity data for a specific channel
dapi_intensities = image.get_intensities_from_channel(DAPI)

# The returned array preserves temporal/spatial dimensions
dapi_intensities.shape  # (256, 256)
```
