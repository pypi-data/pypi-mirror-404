# iKALI v2.0.0

iKali is a terrible program fuelled by hate and death. this program barely works correctly, 
and cannot run on windows for reasons i seriously do not know or understand. 
Please note that this crap is wholly untested, I am new to programming, and especially using linux. 

# Update 1.0.5 - 
fixed broken keyboard interrupt code causing traceback error.

# Update 1.0.6 - 
Downloading isn't working with previous fix.

# Update 1.0.7 - 
Switched from pip to pipx, citing safety concerns. 

# Update 1.0.8 - 
Testing if releasing on github works with pypi

# Update v1.0.9 - 
figuring out naming conventions- added a "v"

# Update v1.0.10 - 
I cant remember what i did for this update lol. 

# Update v2.0.0 - 
This update adds settings that allows for customisation of the program, reimplements a typewriter effect that was originally planned.
