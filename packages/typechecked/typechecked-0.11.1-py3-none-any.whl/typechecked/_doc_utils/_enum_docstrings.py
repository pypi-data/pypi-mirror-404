# Decorator to attach docstrings to enum members

def enum_docstrings(enum: type[E]) -> type[E]:
    """Attach docstrings to enum members.

    Docstrings are string literals that appear directly below the enum member
    assignment expression within triple-quotes.

    This decorator parses the source code of the enum class to find
    docstrings for each member and attaches them to the respective enum members.

    This allows for more detailed documentation of enum members and in tools
    that can extract and display these docstrings.
