"""Zero-dependency, cross-platform bootstrap script to set up a local Python
development virtual environment.

This is a specialized version of the bootstrap script for projects that
require Python 3.10 or later. It may use features that were deprecated
in later versions of Python, so it is kept separate to ensure compatibility.

It is NOT intended to be run with Python versions earlier than 3.10 
and will exit with an error if attempted.

It has been tested with Python 3.10 through 3.14 as of December 2025.

This script is part of the 'python-env-bootstrap' project available at
https://github.com/JerilynFranz/python-env-bootstrap

Instructions
------------

This script performs the **MINIMUM** steps required to set up a local
development environment for a Python project. It creates a virtual environment,
installs necessary development tools, and performs any project-specific
setup steps.

It is expected to be customized as needed for each project by modifying
the constants and functions defined in this script.

It DOES NOT attempt to handle the installation of project dependencies
or other setup tasks beyond the minimum required to get started with
development. Those tasks should be handled by the project's own
dependency management and build tools (e.g., 'uv', 'tox', 'poetry', etc.)

It is intended to get a new developer on a project to the point where they
*CAN* use those tools to manage the rest of the project development environment.

It is designed to be easily customizable and extensible for project-specific
needs. If you wish to add additional setup steps, you can modify the
`run_post_install_steps()` function to perform any additional tasks
required after installing the core development tools.

You should regard this script as a starting point for bootstrapping
your project's development environment, and modify it as needed to suit your
project's specific requirements.

Description
-----------

It is designed to be run after cloning a git or Mercurial repository, to create
a local virtual environment (.venv-tools), and install necessary development tools.

This includes installation of git or Mercurial hooks if applicable.

It relies only on the Python standard library and network access to PyPI and
does not require any pre-installed packages or change your system Python installation.

This example project requires Python 3.10 or later, so this script
checks the Python version meets that requirement before proceeding.

The minimum Python version can be changed as needed for your project and
the lowest supported version is Python 3.10.

This script installs the following tools by default:
- uv (for managing Python packages and dependencies)
- tox (for running tests, linters, and building documentation)
- tox-uv (to integrate uv with tox)
 
That is the minimum set of tools required to start development for this project.

The minimum supported Python version, virtual environment directory name,
and list of tools to install can be customized by modifying the
corresponding constants in this script. The script can also be extended to
perform additional setup steps as needed via the run_post_install_steps() function
such as installing additional packages from requirements.txt files 
or configuring settings.

The choices of installing 'uv' and 'tox' for the bootstrap are just examples;
you can modify the BOOTSTRAP_MODULES list to only include any packages you need
for your development bootstrap workflow.

Settable Options
----------------

- VENV_DIR: The name of the virtual environment directory to create.
- BOOTSTRAP_MODULES: A list of InstallSpec instances specifying the PyPI packages
  to install into the virtual environment during bootstrap.
- POST_INSTALL_MESSAGE: You can customize the message displayed after installation
    by modifying the POST_INSTALL_MESSAGE constant.
- TOOL_USAGE_INSTRUCTIONS: You can customize the usage instructions displayed after installation
    by modifying the TOOL_USAGE_INSTRUCTIONS constant.
- Post-install steps: You can customize the `run_post_install_steps()`
  function to perform additional setup tasks after installing the core tools.
- Output control: You can set `DEFAULT_DEBUG` and `DEFAULT_QUIET` constants
  to control whether debug output or quiet mode is enabled by default.
- Command-line options: You can use '--debug'/'--no-debug' and '--quiet'/'--verbose'
  to control output verbosity when running the script.
- Automatic confirmation: You can use '--yes'/'-y' to skip confirmation prompts.
- You can configure the supported Python versions by modifying
  the version check ("if sys.version_info") at the start of the script.

Usage
-----

python bootstrap.py [-h] [--yes] [--debug | --no-debug] [-q | -v]

CLI Help
--------
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  --yes, -y      Automatically confirm and proceed without prompting.
  --debug        Enable debug output.
  --no-debug     Disable debug output.
  -q, --quiet    Suppress non-error output.
  -v, --verbose  Enable verbose output (default).

You use 'tox' to run tasks that set up and manage the development environment,
run tests, linters, and build documentation:

Examples:

  tox run -e lint     # Run linters on the codebase
  tox run -e docs     # Build documentation
  tox run -e py310    # Run the test suite using Python 3.10
  tox run -e py314    # Run the test suite using Python 3.14
  tox devenv -e dev   # Start an interactive dev environment with Python 3.12

The list of available 'tox' environments can be found by running:

  tox list

If you are not familiar with using 'tox' see https://tox.wiki/en/latest/

You use 'uv' to manage Python packages within the virtual environment and to
update pyproject dependencies:

Examples:

  # Add a new package to the 'dev' dependency group
  uv add --dev --group=dev 'package_name>=1.2.3'

  # Add a new package to the default dependency group
  uv add 'package_name>=1.2.3'

  # Add a package to specified extras
  uv add 'package_name[extra1,extra2]'

  # install a package from PyPI to the virtual environment
  uv pip install 'package_name>=1.2.3'

See https://docs.astral.sh/uv/ for more information on using 'uv'.

If you are using VSCode, you can select the Python interpreter from the
development virtual environment located in the 'venv' directory within the
repository root after activating the environment with 'tox devenv -e dev'.

Make sure to select the interpreter from the activated virtual environment
so that VSCode uses the correct packages installed in that environment.

If you can't find the interpreter in the list, you should look in VSCode's
Settings under "Python: Use Environments Extension" and enable that option to have VSCode
list virtual environments automatically. That should add the activated venv's interpreter
to the list of available interpreters under a name like 'python-typechecked/venv/bin/python'
(or 'python-typechecked\\venv\\Scripts\\python.exe' on Windows).

If you are using another IDE or editor, refer to its documentation for selecting
the Python interpreter from a virtual environment.

The 'tox' tests include running tests for multiple Python versions and interpreters.
The tests for 'pypy' and 'pypy3' interpreters require that 'rust' is installed on your system
so that the 'pyo3' package can be built.

If you do not have 'rust' installed, you can skip running tests for 'pypy' and 'pypy3'
by excluding those environments when running 'tox', e.g.:
    tox run -e py310,py311,py312,py313,py314
