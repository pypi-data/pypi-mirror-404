# Stata Package Installation

## Overview

The package installation module provides a convenient way to install Stata packages from the Statistical Software Components (SSC) archive. It supports automated package installation within Stata-MCP workflows, making it easy to extend Stata's functionality programmatically.

## Key Features

### SSC Archive Integration

Directly installs packages from the Boston College Statistical Software Components archive:

- **Automatic Installation**: Installs packages with a single command
- **Dependency Handling**: Stata's package manager handles dependencies automatically
- **Version Management**: Supports updating existing packages with the `replace` option

### Cross-Platform Support

Works on all supported operating systems:

- **Windows**: Full support through Stata's batch execution mode
- **macOS**: Native support through Stata CLI
- **Linux**: Native support through Stata CLI

### Installation Verification

The module provides built-in verification to ensure successful installation:

- Checks for installation success messages
- Handles already-installed packages gracefully
- Returns clear status messages for troubleshooting

## Use Cases

- **Automated Setup**: Install required packages in automated research workflows
- **Environment Initialization**: Prepare Stata environments with necessary packages
- **Missing Package Recovery**: Automatically install packages when commands are not found
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Set up consistent Stata environments in automated testing

## How It Works

1. **Command Construction**: Builds the appropriate `ssc install {package}` command
2. **Stata Execution**: Sends the installation command to Stata CLI
3. **Result Verification**: Checks the output for success indicators
4. **Status Reporting**: Returns the installation status and any messages

## Installation Behavior

By default, the installer uses the `replace` option:

- **New Packages**: Installs the package for the first time
- **Existing Packages**: Replaces with the latest version from SSC
- **Up-to-Date Packages**: Skips installation if already at the latest version

## Common Packages

Some frequently installed packages include:

- **`estout`**: Regression and estimation tables
- **`outreg2`**: Alternative regression table output
- **`coefplot`**: Coefficient plots
- **`tabout`**: Export tables to various formats
- **`graphexport`**: Enhanced graph export options

## Error Handling

The module handles common installation scenarios:

- Package not found on SSC
- Network connectivity issues
- File permission problems
- Stata license limitations

## Example Workflow

```stata
// Install a package
ssc install estout

// The module handles:
// 1. Downloading from SSC
// 2. Installing to your Stata ado directory
// 3. Setting up help files
// 4. Verifying installation
```

## Notes

- Requires internet connection for SSC access
- Installation speed depends on package size and network connection
- Some packages may have additional system requirements
- Always verify package functionality after installation
