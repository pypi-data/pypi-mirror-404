        ## Termination
        
        If you use the software in violation of these terms, such use is not licensed,

        a notice of your violation, and you cease all violation of this license no later
        than 30 days after you receive that notice, your licenses will be reinstated
        retroactively. However, if you violate these terms after such reinstatement, any
        additional violation of these terms will cause your licenses to terminate
        automatically and permanently.

# urimai

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/urimai)](https://pypi.org/project/urimai/)
[![Python 3.11+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.11%2B-blue)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

**AI-powered SQL answer engine** — ask questions about your databases in plain English.

## What is urimai?

urimai lets you query SQLite databases and CSV files using natural language.
Point it at your data, ask a question, and urimai figures out the right SQL,
runs it, and explains the results. It also profiles your columns and runs
data-quality checks automatically when you register a database, so you can
understand your dataset before you start exploring.

## Key features

- **Natural language SQL** — ask questions in plain English, get SQL + results + explanations
- **CSV import** — drop in a CSV file and urimai converts it to SQLite with LLM-powered schema inference
- **Data profiling** — automatic column-level statistics (min, max, nulls, distributions)
- **Quality checks** — data-quality rules generated and evaluated by the LLM
- **Export** — data dictionaries in Excel or Markdown
- **Multi-provider LLM** — supports Google Gemini and OpenAI out of the box

## Requirements

- **Python 3.11 or later** — [download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- An API key from [Google Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) or [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

## Quick start

```bash
pip install urimai        # install from PyPI
urim setup                # configure your API provider and key
urim init ./mydata.db     # register a SQLite database (or CSV)
urim chat mydata          # start asking questions
```

## Command reference
