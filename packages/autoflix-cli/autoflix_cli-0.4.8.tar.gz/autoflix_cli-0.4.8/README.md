# Autoflix 🍿

> Watch movies, series, and anime in French (VF & VOSTFR) directly from your terminal.

**Autoflix** is a CLI inspired by `ani-cli`. It scrapes links from popular streaming sites (**Coflix**, **French-Stream** and **Anime‑Sama**) to let you stream content without opening a browser.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** This project was developed very quickly with heavy use of AI. The main goal was functionality over code cleanliness or optimization. I apologize for the "spaghetti code", I just wanted it to work!
