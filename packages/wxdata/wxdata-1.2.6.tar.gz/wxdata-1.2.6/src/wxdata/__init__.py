"""
This section of functions are for users who want full wxdata functionality.

These functions do the following:

1) Scan for the latest available data. 
    - If the data on your local machine is not up to date, new data will download automatically.
    - If the data on your local machine is up to date, new data download is bypassed.
    - This is a safeguard that prevents excessive requests on the data servers.
    
2) Builds the wxdata directory to store the weather data files. 
    - Scans for the directory branch and builds the branch if it does not exist. 

3) Downloads the data.
    - Users can define their VPN/PROXY IP Address as a (dict) in their script and pass their
      VPN/PROXY IP address into the function to avoid SSL Certificate errors when requesting data.
    - Algorithm allows for up to 5 retries with a 30 second break between each retry to resolve connection
      interruptions while not overburdening the data servers. 

4) Pre-processes the data via filename formatting and correctly filing in the wxdata directory. 

5) Post-processing by doing the following tasks:
     - Remapping GRIB2 variable keys into plain language variable keys.
     - Fixing dataset build errors and grouping all variables together.
     - Transforms longitude from 0 to 360 degrees into -180 to 180 degrees.
     - Subsetting the data to the latitude/longitude boundaries specified by the user. 
     - Converting temperature from kelvin to units the user wants (default is Celsius).
     - Returning a post-processed xarray.array to the user. 
     
6) Preserves system memory by doing the following:
     - Deleting old data files before each new download.
     - When clear_recycle_bin=True, the user's recycle bin is also cleared.

This section hosts the utility functions accessable to the user. 

These functions provide helpful utilities when analyzing weather data. 

Utility functions are geared towards the following types of users:

1) Users who want to use their own scripts to download the data however, they
   would like to use the wxdata post-processing capabilities. 
   
2) Users who want to make hemispheric graphics or any graphics where cyclic points
   resolve missing data along the prime meridian or international dateline.
