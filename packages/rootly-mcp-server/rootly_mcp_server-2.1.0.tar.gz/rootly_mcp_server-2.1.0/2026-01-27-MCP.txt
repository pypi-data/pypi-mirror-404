⏺ I can see the improvement plan is already created. Let me check the beads
  status to see what tasks are ready to work on.

⏺ Bash(bd ready)
  ⎿ 📋 Ready work (6 issues with no blockers):

    1. [● P2] [task] Rootly-MCP-server-a8z: Add output schemas to MCP tools
    … +9 lines (ctrl+o to expand)


⏺ I can see the improvement plan and beads are ready. The previous session was
  trying to set up the mcp-openai server to get GPT-4o to review the plan, but
  there were configuration issues.

  Let me check if the OpenAI MCP server is now available. If not, I'll propose a
   path forward.

  Based on the beads, the highest priority security tasks from Stage 1 of the
  plan are:
  - Rootly-MCP-server-561: Stop logging API token prefixes (HIGH priority
  security)
  - Rootly-MCP-server-jds: Remove traceback exposure (HIGH priority security)

  Since the GPT-4o review setup had technical issues and you want to continue
  the work, I have two options:

  1. Skip GPT-4o review for now and start implementing Stage 1 (Critical
  Security Fixes) - the two high-priority security beads above
  2. Try one more time to get GPT-4o review via a different method (manual paste
   to ChatGPT, or check if the MCP server is now working)

  Which would you prefer? The security issues are critical and should be fixed
  soon, but if you still want external validation on the plan first, we can
  pursue that.

⏺ Let me check if the OpenAI MCP server is now available and working.

⏺ The configuration looks correct, but I don't see any OpenAI-specific tools
  available to me, which suggests the mcp-openai server didn't load
  successfully. Let me check the Claude logs to see if there were any errors.

⏺ Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ I notice there's no mcp-server-mcp-openai.log file, which suggests the server
  never started. Let me check the main MCP log for errors:

⏺ Searched for 1 pattern (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Let me test if the mcp-openai package can be installed and run:

⏺ Bash(npx -y @mzxrai/mcp-openai@latest --help 2>&1 | head -20) timeout: 30s

⏺ Good - the package exists and requires the API key. Let me test with the
  actual key to verify it works:

⏺ I see the issue - I'm Claude Code (CLI), not Claude Desktop. The configuration
   you updated is for Claude Desktop, but I'm running as the CLI tool which has
  a separate configuration. Let me search for how to configure MCP servers for
  Claude Code CLI:

⏺ Perfect! Now I understand. Claude Code CLI uses a different configuration than
   Claude Desktop. Let me add the mcp-openai server to Claude Code CLI:

      5 ## 1. Security Assessment
      6 
      7 **Addressed Concerns:** The plan effectively addresses several cr
        itical security concerns, such as logging API tokens, exposing st
        ack traces, and lack of input validation. These are essential cor
        rections that should be prioritized.
      8 
      9 **Missing Considerations:** While the plan covers some high-prior
        ity security issues, it lacks details on encryption for data in t
        ransit and at rest, protection against common web vulnerabilities
         like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site r
        equest forgery (CSRF). Additionally, there is no mention of secur
        ity audits or penetration testing to validate the effectiveness o
        f the implemented security measures.

      15  **What's wrong:**
      16  - Your API tokens are being logged (even partially) which is a 
          security risk
      17  - Error messages contain full stack traces that expose internal
           file paths and implementation details
      18  - No validation that URLs and tokens are properly formatted bef
          ore using them
      19 +- Missing HTTPS enforcement and data-in-transit protection

           only)

⏺ Perfect! I've updated the improvement plan based on GPT-4o's comprehensive
  review. Here's what changed:

  Key Enhancements Added:

  1. Stage 1 expanded (1.5 weeks now):
    - HTTPS enforcement
    - Input sanitization
    - Rate limiting
    - Security auditing tools (bandit, safety)
    - Dependency vulnerability scanning
  2. Stage 4 significantly enhanced (2 weeks now):
    - CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
    - Detailed testing strategy (unit, integration, E2E, security tests)
    - TDD approach for new features
    - Automated linting and security scanning
  3. Stage 6 expanded (2 weeks):
    - Structured logging with correlation IDs
    - Monitoring and observability (health checks, metrics, alerting)
    - Developer training materials
  4. Timeline extended to 8-10 weeks (more realistic)
  5. Additional risks added:
    - Team resource changes
    - Unforeseen technical debt

  Now, regarding your question about the Rootly API key - I can see you already
  have it configured in your Claude Desktop config. For Claude Code CLI to
  access it, you have several secure options:

  Option 1: Environment Variable (Most Secure)
  export ROOTLY_API_TOKEN="your-token-here"

  Option 2: Add to Claude Code CLI MCP Config
  Similar to how we added the OpenAI server, but I notice you already have a
  Rootly MCP server in your Claude Desktop config. Let me check if it's
  configured for CLI:

⏺ Bash(claude mcp list | grep -i rootly)
  ⎿  No matches found

❯ I am not sure why this is broken down into weeks, we will do everything   
  at once                                                                   

⏺ I see you want to do everything at once rather than in stages. That changes
  the approach significantly! Before we dive into that, let me check your Rootly
   configuration:

⏺ Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Perfect! I can see:

  1. Railway MCP is already configured in your home directory config (line 832)
  2. mcp-openai is working for the current project
  3. You want to do everything at once instead of staged weeks

  Let me address your key points:

  1. "Do Everything At Once" Approach

  Got it! Instead of 8-10 weeks staged, you want to implement all improvements
  in parallel. This means the plan becomes an implementation checklist, not a
  timeline. Let me create that version:

⏺ Write(IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md)
  ⎿  Wrote 182 lines to IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md
       1 # Rootly MCP Server - Implementation Checklist
       2 
       3 **Approach:** All improvements implemented concurrently (not sta
         ged)
       4 **Based on:** GPT-4o reviewed plan (see `GPT4O_REVIEW.md` and `I
         MPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`)
       5 
       6 ## Implementation Checklist
       7 
       8 ### 🔒 Security Fixes
       9 - [ ] Remove all API token logging (stop logging token prefixes)
      10 - [ ] Strip stack traces from error responses (keep server-side 
         only)
     … +172 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ 2. Providing Your Rootly API Key

  You asked how to provide the Rootly API key so I can test the implementation.
  Here are your options:

  Option 1: Environment Variable (Most Secure)
  export ROOTLY_API_TOKEN="your-actual-token-here"
  Then I can access it via os.environ['ROOTLY_API_TOKEN']

  Option 2: Add Rootly MCP Server to Claude Code CLI
  claude mcp add --transport stdio rootly-mcp-server \
    --scope local \
    --env ROOTLY_API_TOKEN="your-token-here" \
    -- uv run --directory
  "/Users/sylvainkalache/Dropbox/work/MCP-servers/Rootly-MCP-server"
  rootly-mcp-server

  Option 3: Create a .env file (make sure it's in .gitignore):
  echo "ROOTLY_API_TOKEN=your-token-here" > .env
  echo ".env" >> .gitignore

  Which approach do you prefer? Once you provide the key via one of these
  methods, I can:
  1. Run the existing MCP server to understand current behavior
  2. Implement all the improvements from the checklist
  3. Test each improvement as I go
  4. Verify everything works before we're done

  Summary of what we've accomplished:
  - ✅ GPT-4o reviewed the improvement plan
  - ✅ Saved GPT-4o feedback to GPT4O_REVIEW.md
  - ✅ Updated IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md with GPT-4o recommendations
  - ✅ Created IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md for "do everything at once" approach
  - ✅ Set up mcp-openai server in Claude Code CLI

  Next: Provide the Rootly API key, and I'll start implementing the checklist!
