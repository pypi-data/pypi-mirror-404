  - Start working on a specific improvement from the review?

  Alternative: If you want GPT-4o integrated permanently                    
  - Install the mcp-openai server (5 min setup with your API key)           
  - Then I can call GPT-4o anytime from our conversations                   
                                                                            
  Which would you prefer? The manual approach is faster for this one-time   
  review, but the MCP server is better if you want ongoing GPT-4o access    
  from

⏺ I've fixed the config and it's ready to go! The mcp-openai server should load
  after you restart Claude Desktop.

  What I did:
  - Added missing comma on line 19 of your Claude config file
  - The mcp-openai server configuration looks correct

  Next step:
  Restart Claude Desktop (quit and reopen), then let me know when you're back.
  Once the MCP server loads, I'll be able to call GPT-4o to review the
  improvement plan.

  While you restart, I want to note one thing: your Rootly API token is visible
  in the config file (line 17). This is exactly one of the security issues we're
   planning to fix in Stage 1 of the improvement plan. After we get GPT-4o's
  review, we should consider moving these tokens to a more secure location like
  a password manager or environment variables.

  Let me know when you're back after the restart! 🚀

⏺ Perfect! Let me check if the mcp-openai server loaded successfully. I'll read
  the improvement plan and then try to use the OpenAI tools.

⏺ Great! Now let me check if I can access the OpenAI MCP server. I'll try to use
   it to get GPT-4o's review of the improvement plan.

  Looking at my available tools, I don't see any OpenAI-specific tools yet. This
   suggests the mcp-openai server might not have loaded successfully. Let me
  help troubleshoot:

  Troubleshooting steps:

  1. Check Claude Desktop logs - Can you check if there are any error messages?
  Logs are usually at:
    - ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log or
    - Look in Claude Desktop's developer console (if available)
  2. Verify the configuration - Let me check your config file again:

⏺ Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Found the issue! The JSON structure is wrong. The mcp-openai and rootly
  configurations are outside the "mcpServers" object. They need to be inside it.

⏺ Perfect! I found and fixed the issue. The rootly and mcp-openai configurations
   were outside the "mcpServers" object. I've moved them inside where they
  belong.

  You need to restart Claude Desktop again for this fix to take effect.

  After you restart:
  1. The mcp-openai server should load properly
  2. I'll be able to see and use OpenAI tools
  3. I can then have GPT-4o review the improvement plan

  Go ahead and restart Claude Desktop one more time, then let me know when
  you're back!
