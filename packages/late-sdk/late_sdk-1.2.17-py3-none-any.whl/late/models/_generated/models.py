    Use `POST /v1/media/presign` to get a presigned URL, then upload your file directly to cloud storage.
    Supports files up to 5GB. See the `/v1/media/presign` endpoint documentation for details.

    **Automatic Media Compression:**
    Late automatically compresses media that exceeds platform limits, so you don't need to worry about file size restrictions. Compression happens server-side during publishing.

    **Image compression by platform:**
    - Twitter/X: >5 MB
    - Instagram: >8 MB
    - Threads: >8 MB
    - Facebook: >10 MB
    - LinkedIn: >8 MB
    - TikTok: >20 MB
