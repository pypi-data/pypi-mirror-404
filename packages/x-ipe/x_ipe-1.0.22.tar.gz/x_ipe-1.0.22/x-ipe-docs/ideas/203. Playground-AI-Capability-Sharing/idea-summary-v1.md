# Idea Summary

> Idea ID: IDEA-012
> Folder: 203. Playground-AI-Capability-Sharing
> Version: v1
> Created: 2026-01-26
> Status: Refined

## Overview

A 30-minute AI Capability Sharing presentation designed to **drive interest and curiosity about AI** among a mixed audience (technical and business). The presentation showcases AI capabilities through 4 live demo scenarios in an integrated project environment, using the Chanel brand theme.

## Problem Statement

Teams need to understand how AI can transform their daily workflows, but abstract explanations don't resonate. A live demonstration through practical, relatable scenarios will create genuine interest and curiosity about AI adoption.

## Target Users

- **Primary:** Mixed audience (IT and Business stakeholders)
- **Context:** Internal knowledge sharing session
- **Goal:** Inspire curiosity, not teach technical details

## Proposed Solution

An 8-slide presentation with live demonstrations covering:
1. **Mindset Framework** - "Small Loop + Big Loop" concept
2. **4 Live Demo Scenarios** - Practical workflows using AI capabilities
3. **Forward-Looking Close** - Preview of next week's deep dive

- AI researches POS best practices online
- AI summarizes knowledge about building POS systems
- AI generates structured report

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 4 live demos execute successfully without errors
- [ ] Audience shows engagement (questions, interest)
- [ ] Presentation completes within 30 minutes
- [ ] Key mindset concept (loops) is understood
- [ ] Curiosity is sparked for next week's session

## Technical Setup Required

- Web browser with AI Agent access
- Microphone for voice commands
- Pre-configured project environment
- Chanel brand theme loaded
- Stable internet connection

## Brainstorming Notes

Key insights from refinement session:
- **Audience:** Mixed technical/business - keep explanations accessible
- **Objective:** Drive curiosity, not deep technical training
- **Tone:** Positive and inspiring (limitations saved for Q&A)
- **Demo approach:** All live - creates authentic impact
- **Theme:** Chanel brand styling for professional look
- **Structure:** 8 slides, 30 minutes - roughly 3-4 min per slide

## Source Files

- new idea.md (original brainstorm notes)

## Next Steps

- [ ] Proceed to **Create PPT** using this refined idea
- [ ] Prepare demo environment with all scenarios
- [ ] Practice timing for 30-minute delivery
- [ ] Set up backup recordings in case of demo failure

## References & Common Principles

### Applied Principles

- **Show, Don't Tell:** Live demos create more impact than slides with bullet points
- **Storytelling Structure:** Opening → Framework → Examples → Conclusion
- **Mixed Audience Communication:** Use analogies (factory/robot) for technical concepts

### Presentation Best Practices

- Keep slides minimal - the demo is the star
- Have fallback plan if live demo fails
- End with curiosity hook for next session
