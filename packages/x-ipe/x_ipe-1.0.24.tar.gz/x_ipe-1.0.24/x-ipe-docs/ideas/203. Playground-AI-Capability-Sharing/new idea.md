today I need to do a AI Capability sharing

I would like to create PPT for presentation, following are the today's topics:

1. slide 1
Title hint: AI Capability Review Through Practice
The AI Capabilities will be reviewed today:
*  Access AI Agent through Web Application
*  AI Skills Review
	- Brainstorming
	- Web searching
	- File System Accessing
	- Making PPT
	- Create UIUX Mockup
	- Rule Based Works
	- Calling programing tools
*  Voice to Text and Live Translation
*  Memory for AI

The Scenarios will be shown today:
the scenarios below are typical works in the workflow in day to day work
*  Ideation Refinement With AI
*  Create Reporting PPT
*  Create Application UIUX Mockup
*  Ideation to Requirement Delivery

* All the scenarios will be demo in a integrated project environment.

2. slide 2
title hint: before start, let's quickly review the AI capablity using mindset
I belive in order to leverage AI capability we need a small loop and a big loop, small loop is part of big loop.
- big loop: it's like a factory, we have robots in it, and robots will make pipline to speed up products making.
- small loop: it's like a robots, as long as robot have full power enabled, it can iterative upgrade itself to make it better to envolving pipeline in factory.
so small loop makes itself better witch will drive big loop, business performance better.

so if we think AI is good, let's empower ourself - 'IT department' first. But first, let's see how AI enpower I.

3. slide 3
scenario 1: Ideation Refinement With AI
* Human Draft an idea, to create a POS application for boutique sales

7. side 7
title hint: what does the demo means to us
It is:
- the ways of working in future 6 - 2 years.
- experiance with AI capability
- a thinking driving my performance

it is not
- it is not the capability industry average adopted
- it is not complaince or security reviewed
- it is not team working scaling proven

8. side 8
next week topic: AI is fancy, let's deep dive the behind scene.
- What makes AI Agent so powerful, what AI agent consists of.

other optional topic: knowledge base, and what's the future model for human and AI to use knowledge base.
