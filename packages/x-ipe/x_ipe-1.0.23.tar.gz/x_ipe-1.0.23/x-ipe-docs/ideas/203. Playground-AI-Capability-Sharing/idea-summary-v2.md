# Idea Summary

> Idea ID: IDEA-012
> Folder: 203. Playground-AI-Capability-Sharing
> Version: v2
> Created: 2026-01-26
> Status: Refined

## Overview

A 30-minute AI Capability Sharing presentation designed to **drive interest and curiosity about AI** among a mixed audience (technical and business). The presentation showcases AI capabilities through 4 live demo scenarios in an integrated project environment, using the Chanel brand theme.

## Problem Statement

Teams need to understand how AI can transform their daily workflows, but abstract explanations don't resonate. A live demonstration through practical, relatable scenarios will create genuine interest and curiosity about AI adoption.

## Target Users

- **Primary:** Mixed audience (IT and Business stakeholders)
- **Context:** Internal knowledge sharing session
- **Goal:** Inspire curiosity, not teach technical details

## Proposed Solution

An 8-slide presentation with live demonstrations covering:
1. **AI Capabilities Overview** - What will be demonstrated today
2. **Mindset Framework** - "Small Loop + Big Loop" concept
3. **4 Live Demo Scenarios** - Practical workflows using AI capabilities
4. **Forward-Looking Close** - What this means + Preview of next week's deep dive

## Presentation Structure

| Order | Slide Type | Description | Est. Time |
|-------|------------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | Opening | AI Capabilities Overview | 2 min |
| 2 | Concept | AI Mindset: Small Loop + Big Loop | 3 min |
| 3 | Demo | Scenario 1: Ideation Refinement | 6 min |
| 4 | Demo | Scenario 2: Create Reporting PPT | 5 min |
| 5 | Demo | Scenario 3: Create UI/UX Mockup | 5 min |
| 6 | Demo | Scenario 4: Ideation to Requirements | 5 min |
| 7 | Reflection | What This Demo Means | 2 min |
| 8 | Closing | Next Week Preview | 2 min |

## Slide Content Details

### Slide 1: AI Capability Review Through Practice

**Purpose:** Set the stage for what audience will see today

**AI Capabilities to be reviewed:**
- Access AI Agent through Web Application
- AI Skills:
  - Brainstorming
  - Web searching
  - File System Accessing
  - Making PPT
  - Create UI/UX Mockup
  - Rule Based Works
  - Calling programming tools
- Voice to Text and Live Translation
- Memory for AI

**Scenarios to be demonstrated:**
- Ideation Refinement With AI
- Create Reporting PPT
- Create Application UI/UX Mockup
- Ideation to Requirement Delivery

**Note:** All scenarios will be demo in an integrated project environment.

### Slide 2: AI Mindset - Small Loop + Big Loop

**Purpose:** Establish the mental framework for AI adoption before diving into demos

**Design Request:** Use a creative visual metaphor to illustrate this concept. Consider:
- Factory/Robot analogy visualization
- Nested loops or cycles diagram
- Or any creative approach that makes the concept memorable

**Key Concept:**

**Big Loop (The Factory)**
- Like a factory with robots inside
- Robots make pipelines to speed up product making
- Represents business performance and organizational AI adoption

**Small Loop (The Robot)**
- Like an individual robot with full power enabled
- Can iteratively upgrade itself to become better
- Evolves the pipeline in the factory
- Small loop improvements drive big loop (business) performance

**Key Message:** "If we think AI is good, let's empower ourselves - 'IT department' first. But first, let's see how AI empowers me."
