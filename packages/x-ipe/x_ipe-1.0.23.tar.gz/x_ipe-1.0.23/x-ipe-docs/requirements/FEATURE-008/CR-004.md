## Request Details

**Requestor:** User
**Date Received:** 2026-01-28
**Priority:** Medium

## Description

Restructure the Workplace sidebar navigation to use a submenu pattern:

1. **Sidebar Changes**: Workplace becomes a parent menu item with always-visible nested children (no action on parent click)
2. **Ideation Subpage**: Rename existing Workplace page to "Ideation" with sidebar icon + label
3. **Copilot Button Changes**: Make non-clickable; add hover menu with "Refine idea" at top (above 3 existing options)
4. **UIUX Feedbacks Subpage**: New page with "Work in Progress" banner placeholder

## Business Justification

- Better organization of related functionality under a parent category
- Separation between ideation workflows and UIUX feedback collection  
- More intuitive Copilot button interaction with explicit action choices
- Future extensibility for additional submenu items

## Impact Analysis

### Classification

**Type:** Modification to FEATURE-001 & FEATURE-008 + New Feature (FEATURE-022)

**Reasoning:**

| Change | Type | Reason |
|--------|------|--------|
| Sidebar submenu | MODIFICATION | Extends existing navigation pattern, no new data models |
| Workplace → Ideation | MODIFICATION | Page rename, same functionality |
| Copilot hover menu | MODIFICATION | Adds options to existing button behavior |
| UIUX Feedbacks page | NEW FEATURE | New page, new placeholder capability |

### Affected Components

| Component | Impact Level | Details |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| FEATURE-001: Project Navigation | Medium | Add submenu support for Workplace parent |
| FEATURE-008: Workplace | High | Rename to Ideation, Copilot button behavior change |
| Sidebar UI | Medium | Nested indented items, parent no-action behavior |
| Copilot Button | Medium | Non-clickable, hover menu with 4 options |
| FEATURE-022 (new) | Low | Simple WIP placeholder page |

### Dependencies

- FEATURE-001 must support submenu/nested navigation pattern
- Existing Workplace functions (upload, preview, history, mockups) must continue working

## Proposed Approach

### Phase 1: Sidebar Submenu (FEATURE-001)
- Add submenu support to sidebar navigation component
- Configure Workplace as parent with always-visible nested children
- Parent click does nothing (no redirect)

### Phase 2: Ideation Page (FEATURE-008 v1.4)
- Rename "Workplace" to "Ideation" throughout UI
- Update sidebar icon with label
- Verify all existing functions work after rename

### Phase 3: Copilot Hover Menu (FEATURE-008 v1.4)
- Remove direct click behavior from Copilot button
- Add hover/dropdown menu with 4 options:
  1. Refine idea (NEW - triggers original click behavior)
  2. [Existing option 2]
  3. [Existing option 3]
  4. [Existing option 4]

### Phase 4: UIUX Feedbacks Page (FEATURE-022)
- Create new route/page
- Add as second nested item under Workplace
- Show simple "Work in Progress" banner
- Minimal implementation, placeholder only
