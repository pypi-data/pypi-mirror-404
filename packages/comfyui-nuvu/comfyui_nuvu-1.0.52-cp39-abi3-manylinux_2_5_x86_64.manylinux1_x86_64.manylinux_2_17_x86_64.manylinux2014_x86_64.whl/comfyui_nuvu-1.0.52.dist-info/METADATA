## The Nuvu Advantage

The Nuvu Plug-in for ComfyUI gives you instant access to premium workflows specifically designed for production pipelines. The Nuvu difference is when you download a workflow, you get everything needed to run the workflow. No more searching for obscure custom nodes or models. On top of that, the workflows are condensed into easy-to-use subgraphs that can be searched just like any node. Let's walk through an example.

Let's install Z-Image-Turbo
![alt text](docs/images/z-image-turbo-download.png)

After clicking Install, all workflows, subgraphs, custom nodes, and models for running Z-Image-Turbo will install.
![alt text](docs/images/z-image-download-summary.png)

Now let's restart ComfyUI, and check out what was installed for us!

This is the workflow that was downloaded. It contains a Z-Image-Turbo subgraph with documentation for what all of the inputs and outputs of the subgraph do. The models were already installed, so just click "Run" and as long as you have the VRAM to run the workflow, it will run immediately.

![alt text](docs/images/z-image-turbo-workflow-image.png)

Here is the searchable subgraph. Search for it as you would any other node, and connect it into your favorite image-to-video workflow or anywhere else you'd like.
![alt text](docs/images/z-image-subgraph.png)

Nuvu has created an extremely efficient pipeline for getting workflows into your hands quickly, so when a new model is released, Nuvu is committed to delivering the capability to you quickly and seamlessly.

## Installing Nuvu

Nuvu Labs offers a variety of ways to install the Nuvu Plug-in into ComfyUI for optimal convenience.

### Auto-Installers

Download the applicable script for your system, which can be found [at this link](https://github.com/Nuvulabs/ComfyUI-Nuvu/releases).

#### Windows Install

Install git through the instructions found on the github website here: [GitHub Git install instructions](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)

Place the .bat file in the folder location on windows that you want to install ComfyUI-Nuvu in. Double click on the .bat file, and it will start to install ComfyUI with Nuvu.
![alt text](docs/images/batFileInstall.png)

Inside the ComfyUI Folder, you will find a file called "run_comfy.bat". Double click this file to launch ComfyUI. Wait until the terminal stops producing text and then go to the next step.
![alt text](docs/images/batRunComfy.png)

You will also find a shortcut on your desktop, and a link in your start menu
![alt text](docs/images/desktop-start-menu.png)

Your default browser should pop open when ComfyUI starts. You can slo navigate to [localhost:8188](localhost:8188) or [127.0.0.1:8188](127.0.0.1:8188) in your web browser of choice (Firefox or Google Chrome recommended).

#### Linux Install
Place the .sh file in the folder location that you want to install ComfyUI-Nuvu in. Open a shell and run:

```./linux_install_nuvu_comfy.sh```

This will clone ComfyUI into your current folder. Inside the ComfyUI Folder, you will find a file called "run_comfy.sh". Double click this file or open a shell and run it to launch ComfyUI. Wait until the terminal stops producing text and then go to the next step. You should also see a Nuvu-ComfyUI icon on your desktop, which you can use to launch Nuvu.

Navigate to [localhost:8188](localhost:8188) or [127.0.0.1:8188](127.0.0.1:8188) in your web browser of choice (Firefox or Google Chrome recommended).

### Comfy Manager

Install and open the [ComfyUI-Manager](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI-Manager)
![Open Comfy Manager](docs/images/ComfyManagerOpen.png)


Search for "Nuvu" and click the ComfyUI-Nuvu "Install" button.
![Comfy Manager Nuvu Search](docs/images/ComfyManagerNuvu.png)

Click "Restart" after the install completes, and then refresh your browser after ComfyUI comes back online.
![Restart from Comfy Manager](docs/images/RestartComfyManager.png)

After restarting, you should see the Nuvu button in your toolbar.
![Nuvu Button After Manager Install](docs/images/NuvuButtonManagerInstall.png)

### RunPod Template

Use our referral code to sign up for RunPod if you don't already have an account! [https://runpod.io?ref=ffbuz4zw](https://runpod.io?ref=ffbuz4zw)

Nuvu Labs provides a RunPod template to quickly deploy ComfyUI from anywhere, even if you don't own a GPU yourself. You can find it [at this link](https://console.runpod.io/deploy?template=0lhzij38ow&ref=ffbuz4zw)

When you click on the link and have a valid account created, you'll be prompted to start a pod.
![RunPod select pod](docs/images/nuvu-storage-runpod-pods.png)

Nuvu Labs recommends setting up Network storage of 500gb minimum, preferably up to 1TB or more to handle the large size of the models. This will allow you to keep all your work and you won't have to restart all over again each time you start a new pod.

Select your network storage, and CUDA Versions as shown below. CUDA 12.8 or 12.9 are required becasue of blackwell architecture support for RTX 50xx series.
![Pod Storage and Cuda Settings](docs/images/PodStorageCuda.png)

Then select a GPU from the list below. For most production work, Nuvu Labs recommends an RTX 5090 at minimum. RTX 5090 is an excellent balance of speed and value.

Once you've selected your GPU, and confirm that the ComfyUI-Nuvu template is selected, click "Deploy On-Demand"
![Confirm Template and click deploy](docs/images/ConfirmTemplate.png)

If this is your first time launching ComfyUI on your network storage or if you do not plan to use a network storage, expect about 20mins of first time setup.

Go to the logs of your RunPod pod, and wait until you see the circled message in the container logs. That tells you that ComfyUI is ready.
![Look for comfyui browser address in logs](docs/images/podStartup.png)

Click "Connect", and then click "ComfyUI" to open ComfyUI. A JupyterLab session is also provided, where you can view the pod's filesystem.
![alt text](docs/images/podComfyUIStart.png)

## Using Nuvu

### Workflow Installer
![Workflow Installer Quick View](docs/images/WorkflowInstaller.png)

Choose from over 100 optimized workflows to install directly into you ComfyUI environment. No need to worry about installing custom nodes or models, everything will install for you.

#### Subgraphs
![Subgraph Example](docs/images/SubgraphExample.png)

When a workflow is installed, its subgraphs are also added to your library. Search for them like any other custom node, and chain them together for maximum productivity.

### Install Missing

![Install Missing Example](docs/images/InstallMissingExample.png)

Allow users to open any workflow in ComfyUI and Nuvu will attempt to find all custom nodes and models needed for that workflow, and install them for you. No more searching through the manager or scouring huggingface to find the correct model. It is the user's responsiblity to verify all of the files and custom nodes are compatible with their environment. Nuvu does not guarantee stability through the Install Missing feature.

### Model Installer
Choose from ~2000 models to install directly into your ComfyUI environment.

### ComfyUI Optimizer
Ever had trouble installing SageAttention or Triton, or what about upgrading PyTorch? The ComfyUI Optimizer gives you this ability and more with just a few clicks.
