"""
:mod:`etlplus.file.log` module.

Helpers for reading/writing generic log (LOG) files.

Notes
-----
- A LOG file is a plain text file that contains log messages generated by
    applications or systems.
- Common cases:
    - Each line in the file represents a single log entry.
    - Log entries may include timestamps, log levels, and messages.
    - Formats may vary widely depending on the application generating the logs.
- Rule of thumb:
    - If the file is a generic log file, use this module for reading and
        writing.
