# Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AgentWire ("Project"). This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by contributors to the Project.

## Why a CLA?

AgentWire uses a dual-licensing model: the code is available under AGPL v3 for open source use, and under a commercial license for organizations that prefer not to comply with AGPL terms. To maintain this model and protect the project's sustainability, we need contributors to grant us certain rights.
