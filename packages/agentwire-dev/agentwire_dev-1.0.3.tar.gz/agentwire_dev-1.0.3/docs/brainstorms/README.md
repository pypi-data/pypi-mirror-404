# AgentWire Brainstorms

This directory contains ideas generated by the `brainstorm` scheduled task.

## How It Works

Every 30 minutes, a scheduled task runs that:
1. Reviews existing brainstorms in this directory
2. Either creates a new idea OR refines an existing one
3. Saves the output with a descriptive filename

## File Naming

- `idea-{topic}.md` - New ideas
- `mission-{name}.md` - Mission file drafts
- `refinement-{original}-v{n}.md` - Refined versions of existing ideas

## Review Process

Periodically review these brainstorms and:
- Move promising missions to `docs/missions/later/`
- Delete low-value ideas
- Merge related refinements into consolidated docs
