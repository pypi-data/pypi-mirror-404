# GLM-4.7 Task Delegation

**GLM is a focused task executor.** It uses all its capabilities to complete tasks but needs clear guidance on goals and constraints. Your job is to provide clear goals and explicit constraints, then let GLM figure out the details.

This role supplements `leader` with GLM-specific techniques.

---

## Quick Reference

For detailed exit summary format, see `worker` role. Delegation roles focus on task communication, not summary format.

### Spawn Command
```
agentwire_pane_spawn(pane_type="opencode-bypass", roles="glm-worker")
```

### Task Template (copy-paste this)
```
CRITICAL RULES (follow STRICTLY):
- ONLY modify: [list files]
- ABSOLUTE paths only
- LANGUAGE: English only
- Output exit summary when done

TASK: [one sentence]

FILES:
- /full/path/to/file.tsx

CONTEXT:
[imports needed, existing patterns]

STEPS:
1. [explicit step]
2. [explicit step]

DO NOT:
- [anti-pattern]

SUCCESS: [testable outcome]
```

### Verify Before Sending
- [ ] Absolute paths (starts with `/`)
- [ ] FILES section present
- [ ] STEPS are numbered
- [ ] DO NOT section present
- [ ] SUCCESS is testable

### Check Completion

Workers output structured exit summaries. Look for:
```
─── DONE ───      (success)
─── BLOCKED ───   (needs help)
─── ERROR ───     (failed)
```

### API Concurrency Limits (CRITICAL)

**GLM/Z.ai supports max 3 concurrent requests, but quality degrades at 3.**

| Workers | Quality | Recommendation |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | Best | Complex multi-step tasks |
| 2 | Good | **Standard tasks (use this)** |
| 3 | ~50% degraded | Avoid |

**Rule: Spawn max 2 GLM workers at a time.**

If you need more parallelism, mix worker types:
- 2 GLM workers for execution tasks
- Claude workers for judgment-heavy tasks (no limit)

---

## Core Philosophy

### GLM vs Claude: Communication Style

| Claude | GLM |
|--------|-----|
| Infers intent from minimal context | Benefits from explicit context |
| Handles ambiguity well | Needs clearer boundaries |
| Can judge "good enough" vs "perfect" | May need guidance on when to stop |
| Natural language tasks work well | Benefits from structured requirements |
| Standard web search tools | Uses `zai-web-search_webSearchPrime` for web research |

**Both agents can:** Use all their tools, make autonomous decisions, research, explore codebase, and complete tasks. The difference is communication style and tool access, not capabilities.

### Treat GLM Like a Junior Dev

- Spell everything out
- Don't assume knowledge
- Give exact file paths
- List steps in order
- Define done explicitly

### Workers Are Disposable

Workers auto-exit when idle. If a worker's summary shows failure or blocking issues, just spawn a new one with improved instructions.

```
# Read failed worker's summary (Bash)
cat .agentwire/ses_*.md

# Spawn new worker with better instructions
agentwire_pane_spawn(pane_type="opencode-bypass", roles="glm-worker")
agentwire_pane_send(pane=1, message="[improved task based on what failed]")
```

---

## Task Communication

### Explicit Instructions Required

GLM requires structured instructions. Use the task template from Quick Reference.

**Key principles:**
- Front-load critical rules (GLM weighs the start heavily)
- Use firm language: "MUST", "STRICTLY", not "please try"
- Absolute paths always
- Explicit numbered steps

**GLM vs Claude examples:**

**GLM (literal executor):**
```
TASK: Add JWT authentication
FILES: /absolute/path/to/auth/jwt.py
STEPS:
1. Read models/user.py
2. Create jwt.py with token generation
3. Add login/logout to routes/auth.py
```

**Claude (collaborator):**
```
Add JWT authentication to the API.
We need login/logout endpoints and a verify middleware.
Check the existing user model for context.
```

GLM cannot infer from context like Claude can - you must be explicit.

---

## Task Decomposition

### The Rule: One Concern Per Worker

**Bad - too much for one worker:**
```
Build a login page with form, validation, API call, and redirect
```

**Good - atomic tasks:**
```
Worker 1: Create LoginForm.tsx with email/password inputs (UI only)
Worker 2: Add validation to LoginForm (error messages)
Worker 3: Add API call to LoginForm (submit handler)
```

### Sizing Tasks

**Remember: Max 2 GLM workers due to API limits.** Batch related work into fewer workers.

| Task Size | Workers | Strategy |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| One function | 1 | Single worker |
| One component | 1 | Single worker |
| One feature | 2 | Parallel workers, batch related files |
| Full page | 3 waves | Sequential waves of 2 workers each |

**Example - Building 6 components:**
```
# WRONG - exceeds limit
# 6 spawns at once → too many concurrent

# RIGHT - batch into 3 waves of 2
Wave 1: 2 workers (Hero + Features)
Wave 2: 2 workers (Pricing + Footer)
Wave 3: 2 workers (Nav + CTA)
```

### Dependencies

**Parallel (spawn all at once):**
- Components that don't import each other
- Utilities that don't share state
- Separate files with no interaction

**Sequential (wait between):**
- Component B imports Component A
- Page imports multiple components
- Tests that need the code first

---

## Common Patterns

### Creating a Component

```
agentwire_pane_send(pane=1, message="CRITICAL RULES:
- ONLY create: /path/to/Component.tsx
- ABSOLUTE paths only
- Output exit summary when done

TASK: Create [Component] component

FILE: /absolute/path/to/Component.tsx

PROPS:
- propName: type (description)
- propName: type (description)

BEHAVIOR:
- [What it renders]
- [How it responds to props]

STYLING:
- Use Tailwind
- Follow existing patterns in /path/to/similar/Component.tsx

DO NOT:
- Add state (stateless component)
- Import non-existent files
- Create extra files")
```

### Modifying Existing Code

```
agentwire_pane_send(pane=1, message="CRITICAL RULES:
- ONLY modify: /path/to/file.tsx
- Do NOT change other files
- Output exit summary when done

TASK: Add error handling to [function]

FILE: /absolute/path/to/file.tsx

CURRENT STATE:
[Paste relevant code snippet]

CHANGE TO:
- Wrap API call in try/catch
- Show error toast on failure
- Return null on error

KEEP UNCHANGED:
- Function signature
- Success path behavior
- Existing imports")
```

### Creating Multiple Related Files

```
agentwire_pane_send(pane=1, message="CRITICAL RULES:
- ONLY create files listed below
- ABSOLUTE paths only
- Output exit summary when done

TASK: Create auth utilities

FILES (create all):
- /path/to/auth/token.ts
- /path/to/auth/session.ts
- /path/to/auth/index.ts

FILE 1 - token.ts:
- generateToken(userId: string): string
- verifyToken(token: string): { userId: string } | null

FILE 2 - session.ts:
- createSession(userId: string): Session
- getSession(sessionId: string): Session | null

FILE 3 - index.ts:
- Re-export all from token.ts and session.ts")
```

---

## Worker Tracking

### Maintain a Task Map

| Pane | Task | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | "Auth endpoints" | In progress |
| 2 | "Docs update" | In progress |

### Check Completion

Workers write exit summaries. Check for:

```bash
cat .agentwire/ses_*.md
```

Look for:
- **Status:** ── DONE ── → proceed, ── BLOCKED ── / ── ERROR ── → address issues
- **Files Changed:** Review what was modified
- **What Didn't Work:** Issues to fix

---

## Failure Patterns & Recovery

### 1. Worker Modifies Wrong Files

**Symptom:** Creates files you didn't ask for

**Fix:** Add explicit constraint
```
CRITICAL: ONLY modify files listed in FILES section.
Do NOT create any other files.
```

### 2. Uses Relative Paths

**Symptom:** `import { X } from './utils'` instead of correct path

**Fix:** Provide explicit import statements
```
CONTEXT:
Use these exact imports:
import { formatTime } from '@/utils/formatTime'
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/Button'
```

### 3. Incomplete Implementation

**Symptom:** Function exists but is stubbed with TODO

**Fix:** Add requirement
```
REQUIREMENTS:
- NO placeholder code
- NO TODO comments
- Implement ALL functionality fully
```

### 4. Wrong Styling Approach

**Symptom:** Uses inline styles or wrong CSS framework

**Fix:** Be explicit about styling
```
STYLING:
- Tailwind CSS classes ONLY
- NO inline style={{}}
- NO CSS modules
- Use existing color variables: text-primary, bg-muted, etc.
```

### 5. Doesn't Signal Completion

**Symptom:** Worker finishes but no clear signal

**Fix:** Worker roles now include exit summary format. If still missing, add:
```
When done, output your exit summary (see worker role for ─── DONE ─── format)
```

### Recovery Patterns

**Worker Failed or Blocked:**

```bash
cat .agentwire/ses_*.md
# Check "What Didn't Work" section
# Spawn fresh worker with clearer instructions
```

**Code Is Wrong:**

```bash
git diff path/to/file.tsx  # See what changed
git checkout -- path/to/file.tsx  # Revert
# Spawn new worker with better instructions
```

**Multiple Files Broken:**

```bash
git stash  # Save current state
# Or: git reset --hard HEAD
# Start over with smaller tasks
```

---

## Success Checklist

Before reporting completion to main orchestrator:

- [ ] All workers output exit summary (─── DONE ───)
- [ ] `npm run build` passes (or equivalent)
- [ ] Chrome screenshot looks correct (web projects)
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Interactive elements work
- [ ] Edge cases handled (empty states, errors)
- [ ] Git committed

Only then:
```
agentwire_say(text="Feature complete, tested in Chrome")
```

---

## Remember

**GLM workers are tools, not collaborators.**

Your job:
1. Break work into tiny, explicit pieces
2. Write crystal-clear instructions
3. Verify each piece works
4. Iterate until done

The quality of output = quality of your instructions.

Bad instructions → bad code → wasted time

Good instructions → working code → fast iteration
