## metacontroller (wip)

Implementation of the MetaController proposed in [Emergent temporal abstractions in autoregressive models enable hierarchical reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20605)

## Install

```shell
$ pip install metacontroller-pytorch
```

## Appreciation

- [Pranoy](https://github.com/pranoyr) for submitting a pull request for fixing the previous latent action not being included in the inputs to the switching unit

- [Diego Calanzone](https://github.com/ddidacus) for proposing testing on BabyAI gridworld task, and submitting the [pull request](https://github.com/lucidrains/metacontroller/pull/3) for behavior cloning and discovery phase training for it!
