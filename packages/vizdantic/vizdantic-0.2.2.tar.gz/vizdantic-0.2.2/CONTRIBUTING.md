# Contributing

## Code style

- Formatting and linting are handled by Ruff.
- Formatting-only commits are ignored in `git blame`.

Enable blame ignores:
git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs

## Commits

- Keep formatting changes separate from logic.
- Small, focused commits preferred.
