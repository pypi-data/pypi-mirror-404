"""Language-proportional symbol selection utilities.

This module provides functions for language-stratified symbol selection,
ensuring multi-language projects get representation from each language
proportional to its symbol count.

How It Works
------------
Symbol selection in multi-language projects can be dominated by verbose
languages (e.g., Java) that produce many more symbols than concise ones
(e.g., Python). Language-proportional selection addresses this by:

1. Grouping symbols by their source language
2. Allocating symbol budget proportionally by language
3. Selecting within each language up to its budget

This ensures that a Python+Java project with 100 Python symbols and
1000 Java symbols doesn't have its output dominated by Java. Instead,
both languages get representation proportional to their contribution.

Why This Design
---------------
- Uses actual symbol counts, not LOC, for accurate proportions
- Floor guarantee (min_per_language) ensures minority languages appear
- Remainder redistribution gives extra slots to largest languages
- Works with any selection strategy (coverage, centrality, etc.)

Usage
-----
    from hypergumbo_core.selection.language_proportional import (
        group_symbols_by_language,
        allocate_language_budget,
        select_proportionally,
    )

    # Group symbols by language
    lang_groups = group_symbols_by_language(symbols)

    # Allocate budget (e.g., 100 slots total)
    budgets = allocate_language_budget(lang_groups, max_symbols=100)

    # Or use the convenience function for proportional selection
    selected = select_proportionally(
        symbols, centrality, max_symbols=100
    )
