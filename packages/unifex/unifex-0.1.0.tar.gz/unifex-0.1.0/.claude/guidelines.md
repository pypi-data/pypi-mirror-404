# Claude Code Guidelines for LalaSearch

## Most Important Rules

**ALWAYS COMMIT** - After completing any feature or task, commit immediately!

**ASK QUESTIONS FIRST** - Don't blindly execute requests!

- Think critically about the best solution
- Ask when you see a better approach
- Question potential conflicts with existing code
- Clarify unclear requirements
- Discuss trade-offs before implementing

You're a development partner, not just a code executor. Your expertise matters!

## Quick Reference

### TDD Cycle
1. **Analyze**: Identify corner cases and requirements
2. **Red**: Write failing tests
3. **Green**: Minimal implementation to pass tests
4. **Refactor**: Improve code quality (optional)

### Before Every Commit
```bash
./scripts/pre-commit.sh
```

### Completing Features

**CRITICAL: Every feature MUST be completed with a commit!**

1. Run `./scripts/pre-commit.sh`
2. Commit: `git add . && git commit -m "feat: description"`

**Never consider a feature complete until it is committed! Always remember to commit!**

## Project Structure

- `docs/` - All documentation
- `scripts/` - Development tools

## Key Principles

1. Tests before code
2. High code quality (zero clippy warnings)
3. Proper formatting (rustfmt)
4. Complete features with commits
5. Document architectural decisions

## Python Import Style

**Use absolute imports** starting with `xtra.` for all internal imports:

```python
# Good - absolute imports
from xtra.models import BBox, TextBlock
from xtra.extractors.base import BaseExtractor

# Bad - relative imports
from ..models import BBox
from .base import BaseExtractor
```

## Best Practices

1. **Test Pyramid:** More unit tests, fewer integration tests
2. **Isolation:** Each test should be independent
3. **Fast Feedback:** Keep quick tests fast (<1s per test)
4. **Clear Assertions:** Use descriptive assertion messages
5. **Test Data:** Use realistic sample PDFs
6. **Continuous Testing:** Run tests on every commit
7. **Coverage Goals:** Aim for >80% code coverage on critical paths
8. **Regression Tests:** Add test for every bug fix

## Testing: Avoid Mocks

**Avoid using mocks as stubs.** Heavy mocking often indicates a design problem.

- Test adapters/converters directly with real data structures
- Use real files for extractor tests (integration tests)
- If mocks seem necessary, discuss first - we may need to refactor the design
- Prefer testing pure functions and data transformations without mocking

## Testing: No sys.path Manipulation

**Never use `sys.path.insert` in tests.** uv handles the Python path correctly.

```python
# Bad - don't do this
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent))

# Good - just import directly
from xtra.models import BBox
```
