## Motivation

I have a deep interest in TUI/CLI and also movie in general. I also have a vault in Obsidian where I catalogue   movies that I watch but you know how it goes.. (Legend says that it was still there waiting for me :D)
At first, as someone like me whose personality (TUI + Movie) will obviously create a movie player that does everything (find, _torrent_, play, and done) which has already been done so many times. 
So instead I just want to make something different and that's where I (finally) remember about my Obsidian movie catalogue. Then the code begins..

And _also_, I just want to learn new things :)

Can check my personal blog for more info -> [here](https://fa.tinul.net/blog/build-mvw)

## Installation

| Method | Command |
| :----- | :------ |
| pipx *(recommended)* | `pipx install mvw` |
| uv | `uv tool install mvw` |
| pip | `pip install mvw` |


> NOTE: This CLI require a nerdfont to have the icon fully showed
> --> This [repo](https://github.com/officialrajdeepsingh/nerd-fonts-installer) seems legit way to install [nerdfont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) but its up to you how to install, google it, you got this!
> --> Also, If you are on Windows, don't forget to set nerdfont as default font in the settings.

## Usage

```bash
mvw
```

### CLI

```bash
# Configure
mvw config -h

# All configure settings
mvw config --api-key "OMDB API key"       # Required
mvw config --name "Name"                  # Optional
mvw config --poster-width 30
mvw config --theme "gruvbox"
mvw config --moai                         # Toggle
mvw config --review                       # Toggle
mvw config --worldwide-boxoffice          # Toggle
mvw config --hide-key                     # Toggle
mvw config --reset                        # Toggle
mvw config --render                       # choose between pixel (default), blocks, ascii
mvw config --render ascii --charset       # choose between minimal (default), dots, blocks

# List all reviewed movies
mvw list

# Change the poster
mvw poster --id "ttxxxxxx" "poster_path"
mvd poster --title "Inception" "poster_path"

# Preview the reviewed movies
mvw preview --id "ttxxxxxx"
mvd preview --title "Inception"

# Delete the reviewed movies
mvw delete --id "ttxxxxxx"
mvd delete --title "Inception"
```

The `--charset` flag is only available for `--render ascii`. A custom minimal charset was created to better fit the constrained size of the poster. You can also choose dots ("•") and blocks (unicode blocks). This latter option is already similar to what you would get with `--render pixel` or with `--render blocks`. It will give you a lower resolution.

## Configuration

Settings are automatically configured using `mvw config`

## FAQ
```
  ▁▁     ╭─────────────────╮

┌┘└ ░▌   ╰─────────────────╯
╚═══╝     F: Just for fun i guess
```

### Why does the poster pixelated?

During the early build of the project, I could not figure out a way to pipe a kitty image into the [iterfzf](https://github.com/dahlia/iterfzf) preview section. It took a long time to process so I try another method which is using [rich_pixel](https://github.com/darrenburns/rich-pixels) library which supports rich and also works on every OS. As of now, thats what I could think of to solve it. TLDR: you can think it as _the intended style_

### Why do I need to register an API key?

**Short answer:** It's easier for me to implement and it's very fast!

**Long answer:** During the early build, I tried to use an API from TMDb, however I found that the registering process are quite intimidating. Then, I found OMDb (which is almost the same as TMDb but easier API key registration). Later down the road, I also tried a no-API-key path [Cinemagoer](https://github.com/cinemagoer/cinemagoer). However, I couldn't (as of now) make it work yet. Naybe in the future, another non-API option will arise?!

### Who is MOAI?

It is just a console.print that I decided to add a face. I choose Moai because, the emoji 🗿 is just too perfect and one of my friends has used it during the phonk era (a lot). The emoji name is also MOAI so I thought why not just MO(AI) it. Same to LLM in [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), just too good to not use.

mvw is built with [Typer](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) + [iterfzf](https://github.com/dahlia/iterfzf) and inspired by:
