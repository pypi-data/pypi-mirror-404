    Apply 3D mean filter (IBSI code: S60F).

    The mean filter computes the average intensity over an M×M×M
    spatial support. Per IBSI 2 Eq. 2.

    Args:
        image: 3D input image array
        support: Filter support M in voxels (must be odd, YNOF)
        boundary: Boundary condition for padding (GBYQ)

    Returns:
        Response map with same dimensions as input

    Raises:
        ValueError: If support is not an odd positive integer

    Example:
        Apply Mean filter with 15-voxel support:

        ```python
        import numpy as np
        from pictologics.filters import mean_filter

        # Create dummy 3D image
        image = np.random.rand(50, 50, 50)

        # Apply filter
        response = mean_filter(image, support=15, boundary="zero")
        ```

    Note:
        Support M is defined in voxel units as per IBSI specification.
