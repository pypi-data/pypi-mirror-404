"""
IBSI 2 Convolutional Filters for Radiomics.

This module provides standardized image filtering implementations
following the IBSI 2 reference manual specifications.

Filters:
    - Mean filter (S60F)
    - Laplacian of Gaussian (L6PA)
    - Laws kernels (JTXT)
    - Gabor filter (Q88H)
    - Separable wavelets (Haar, Daubechies, Coiflet)
    - Non-separable wavelets / Simoncelli (PRT7)
    - Riesz transform (AYRS)

Example:
    Apply Laplacian of Gaussian filter:

    ```python
    from pictologics.filters import laplacian_of_gaussian

    response = laplacian_of_gaussian(image, sigma_mm=5.0, spacing_mm=2.0)
    ```
