# Quickstart

`filoma` is a fast and flexible Python tool for filesystem analysis. It helps you understand the contents of your directories, profile individual files, and prepare datasets for downstream analysis.

## Installation

```bash
pip install filoma
```

## Two Ways to Get Started

### 1. Interactive CLI (Recommended for Beginners)

Launch the interactive terminal interface for visual exploration:

```bash
filoma                    # Start in current directory
filoma /path/to/analyze   # Start in specific directory
```

Use arrow keys to navigate, probe files and directories, and analyze results with a beautiful terminal interface. Perfect for exploration and ad-hoc analysis.

### 2. Python API (For Scripting and Automation)

For programmatic use, integration into scripts, or Jupyter notebooks:

```python
from filoma import probe_to_df

df = probe_to_df('.')  # Scan current directory
df.df.head()          # View first few rows
```

## Getting Started: The Interactive Demo

The best way to get started with the Python API is to run the interactive demo notebook. It covers the most common workflows in a hands-on way.

## Basic Usage: Scan a Directory

The most common use case is scanning a directory to see what's inside. The `probe_to_df` function scans a path and returns a [Polars](https://pola.rs/) DataFrame, which is great for interactive analysis.

```python
from filoma import probe_to_df

# Scan the current directory and get a DataFrame
df = probe_to_df('.')

# Print the first few rows
print(df.head())
```

This will give you a table with information about each file, like its path, size, and modification time.

## Profile a Single File

You can also get detailed information about a single file using `probe_file`:

```python
from filoma import probe_file

# Profile the README.md file
file_info = probe_file('README.md')

# Print the file's properties
print(file_info.as_dict())
```

## Key Features

- **Fast Scans**: Uses a Rust backend and `fd` for high-performance directory traversal.
- **DataFrame-First**: Easily integrates with the Polars for powerful data manipulation and analysis.
- **Image Profiling**: Extracts metadata from images.
-- **Splitting utilities**: Provides helpers for creating deterministic train/validation/test splits from your file data when preparing datasets.
- **Lazy Loading**: `import filoma` is fast and lightweight. Dependencies like `polars` and `Pillow` are loaded on demand.
