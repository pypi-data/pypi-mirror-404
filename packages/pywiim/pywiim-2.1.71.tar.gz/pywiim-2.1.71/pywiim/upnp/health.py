"""UPnP event health tracking.

This module provides health tracking for UPnP events by detecting when
HTTP polling discovers changes that UPnP events should have caught.

The key insight: We can't detect UPnP health when nothing is changing (no events = healthy),
but we CAN detect it when things ARE changing by comparing what HTTP polling sees vs what
UPnP events report.

class UpnpHealthTracker:
    """Track UPnP event health by detecting missed changes.

    This class monitors state changes detected by HTTP polling and checks
    whether UPnP events also reported those changes. If polling consistently
    detects changes that UPnP missed, we mark UPnP as unhealthy.

    This approach avoids false negatives from time-based detection:
    - Time-based: "No events in X seconds" = unhealthy → WRONG when device is idle
    - Change-based: "Polling saw change, UPnP didn't" = unhealthy → CORRECT

    Example:
        >>> tracker = UpnpHealthTracker()
        >>>
        >>> # After HTTP poll
        >>> tracker.on_poll_update({"play_state": "play", "volume": 50})
        >>>
        >>> # After UPnP event
        >>> tracker.on_upnp_event({"play_state": "play", "volume": 50})
        >>>
        >>> # Check health
        >>> if tracker.is_healthy:
        >>>     print("UPnP working!")
