"""State synchronization for merging HTTP polling and UPnP event data.

This module provides state synchronization that intelligently merges data from
HTTP polling and UPnP events, handling conflicts, stale data, and missing sources.

# pragma: allow-long-file state-synchronization-cohesive
# This file exceeds the 600 LOC hard limit (1097 lines) but is kept as a single
# cohesive unit because:
# 1. Single responsibility: State synchronization logic (HTTP + UPnP merging)
# 2. Well-organized: Clear sections for StateSynchronizer and GroupStateSynchronizer
# 3. Tight coupling: All classes work together for state management
# 4. Maintainable: Clear structure, follows state synchronization design pattern
# 5. Natural unit: Represents one concept (state synchronization)
# Splitting would add complexity without clear benefit.

    The synchronizer can operate in two modes:

    1. **Profile-driven** (recommended): When a DeviceProfile is provided, the

       which source is authoritative for each field. This eliminates guessing
       and makes behavior explicit and predictable.

    2. **Legacy/fallback**: When no profile is provided, the synchronizer uses
       the global SOURCE_PRIORITY dict with freshness-based conflict resolution.
       This maintains backward compatibility but may have subtle bugs on devices
       with specific requirements (e.g., Audio Pro MkII needs UPnP for play_state).
