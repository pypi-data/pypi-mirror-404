"""Framework-agnostic polling strategy helpers for WiiM devices.

This module provides polling strategy recommendations and helpers for applications
managing their own polling loops. The strategy is based on the proven approach
used in the Home Assistant integration, but abstracted to be framework-agnostic.

Applications are responsible for managing their own polling loops. This module
provides recommendations for optimal intervals and conditional fetching logic.

class PollingStrategy:
    """Polling strategy recommendations and helpers.

    This class provides framework-agnostic polling strategy recommendations
    based on device capabilities and state. Applications use these recommendations
    to manage their own polling loops.

    The strategy is based on a Tiered Polling approach:
    - **Tier 1 (Fast):** Playback status (Volume, Play State) - Poll every 1s.
    - **Tier 2 (Context):** Metadata, Output Mode - Poll on change/trigger.
    - **Tier 3 (Slow):** Device Info, Bluetooth, EQ - Poll rarely (60s+).

    **Per-Player Polling Principle:**
    Each player should be polled independently based on its own state. When managing
    multiple players:
    - Each player should have its own polling loop/coordinator
    - Each player should use its OWN `is_playing` state (not the group's or master's)
    - Idle players should use slower polling even if other players are playing
    - This prevents unnecessary fast polling of idle devices

    Example:
        ```python
        from pywiim import WiiMClient, PollingStrategy

        client = WiiMClient("192.168.1.100")
        capabilities = await client._detect_capabilities()
        strategy = PollingStrategy(capabilities)

        # Get recommended interval for THIS player
        role = "solo"
        is_playing = False  # THIS player's state, not the group's
        interval = strategy.get_optimal_interval(role, is_playing)
        print(f"Poll every {interval} seconds")

        # Check if Bluetooth/Device Info should be fetched (Lazy Polling)
        if strategy.should_fetch_configuration(last_config_fetch):
            await client.get_bluetooth_history()
        ```
