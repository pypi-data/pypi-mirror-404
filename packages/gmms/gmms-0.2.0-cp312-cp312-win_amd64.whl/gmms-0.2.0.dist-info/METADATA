# gmms: Ground Motion Models (GMMs) and supporting tools

This repository provides a ground motion models (GMMs) and supporting tools coded in Python and Cython. By default, the Python version of the library is loaded, but the Cython can be selected when desired (see Examples). 
The GMMs available are listed below, and the tools include codes for computing the distances required in GMMs. 

| Ground motion model             | Ground motion intensity measure                                             |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Campbell and Bozorgnia (2010)   | Geometric mean horizontal standardized cumulative absolute velocity (CAVgm) |
| Campbell and Bozorgnia (2011)   | Damage-potential cumulative absolute velocity (CAVdp)                       |
| Campbell and Bozorgnia (2019)   | Arias intensity (Ia)                                                        |
| Campbell and Bozorgnia (2019)   | Cumulative absolute velocity (CAV)                                          |
| Foulser-Piggott and Goda (2015) | Arias Intensity (Ia)                                                        |
| Foulser-Piggott and Goda (2015) | Cumulative absolute velocity (CAV)                                          |


## Example
Three examples on Jupyter Notebooks are presented:
- [Example 1](https://github.com/RPretellD/gmms/blob/main/Examples/Example1.ipynb): Use of Campbell and Bozorgnia models for the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake (single-segment fault). 
- [Example 2](https://github.com/RPretellD/gmms/blob/main/Examples/Example2.ipynb): Use of Campbell and Bozorgnia models for the 2023 Pazarcik Earthquake (multi-segment fault). 
- [Example 3](https://github.com/RPretellD/gmms/blob/main/Examples/Example3.ipynb): Use of the Foulser-Piggott and Goda models for the 2003 Tokachi Earthquake.
