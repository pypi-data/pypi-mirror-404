# Contributing to easycode-infinite

I am the sole owner of this project. To make sure I can focus on making this the best tool possible, please follow these guidelines for feedback and suggestions.

## 1. Why I would like you to listen
I want to spend my time coding, not reading low-effort or rude comments. I will only work on feedback that is clear, actionable, and fits the project's goal of being **short and optimized**. If feedback is just an insult or doesn't offer a path to improvement, I will not work on it.

## 2. How you should interect with me
To ensure I see and value your input, please follow these simple rules:

*   **Label your feedback:** If you are giving a suggestion, please start your comment with the word **"FEEDBACK:"**.
*   **Constructive Disagreements:** If you disagree with a design choice, explain your reasoning. Use phrases like **"I disagree because..."** and avoid being rude or telling others they are "wrong."
*   **Respect Opinions:** Follow the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) at all times.

## 3. What I expect the result to be for me to acutally work on it
I am most likely to implement your ideas if they fall into these categories:
*   **Convenience:** Features that make it simpler for others to use the package.
*   **Optimization:** Recommendations on how to make the code even faster or shorter.
*   **Bug Reports:** Explaining clearly why something isn't working so I can fix it.

I reserve the right to decline any suggestions that make the code bloated or too complex.
